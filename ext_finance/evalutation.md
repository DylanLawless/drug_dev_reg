# evaluation

## models
1. asset based - balance sheet
2. ratio based - comparison price/earnings (P/E) ratio to similar company earnings. 
3. discounted cash flow (D.C.F)

## DCF

Ignoring all possible risks and another assumptions:
* A terminal value after x years
* Capital asset pricing value
* liquidity to get return
* I/R 

E.g.
* Cash flow for 4 years
	- CF y1 10m
	- CF y2 10m
	- CF y3 10m
	- CF y4 10m

* loss over 4y due to inflation.

* interest rate (I/R) of 10% makes 10m in y1 is worth more than 10m in y4.

* 1/(1+r)^n where r = I/R.

* I/R 10%
	- CF y1 10m = 1/(1+0.1)^1 = 0.91 = 9.1m
	- CF y2 10m = 1/(1+0.1)^2 = 0.82 = 8.2m
	- CF y3 10m = 1/(1+0.1)^3 = 0.75 = 7.5m
	- CF y4 10m = 1/(1+0.1)^2 = 0.68 = 6.8m
	- sum = $31.6m
