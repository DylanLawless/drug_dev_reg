# Risk / reward ratio

* y = risk
* x = reward
* hline = low risk high reward threshold

* model 1 - pay for any analysis
* model 2 - only pay for positive diagnosis

Frequency of positive diagnosis determines whether hline is reached.

Model 2 is more altruistic but requires an unbiased predefined diagnosis criteria. However, these already exist as ACMG and secondary findings.
