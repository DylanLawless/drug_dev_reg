## Intellectual Property - A key to Innovation - Intellectual Property in the 21st Century. Presented by: Natalia Giovannini, Technology Transfer Manager at Innovation park, EPFL.

### Conditions
1. novelty (in the US authors have a 12 month grace period). 
2. invention step - the invetion is not an obvious step to someone skilled in the art.
3. industrial applicability.

### Exceptions to patentability
* In EU, something that is contrary to "ordre public" or morality, or prohibited by law, cannot be patented.
* methods used ... (check the slides - something about medical treatment here).

### Pitfalls
* publication in jornals
* presentation at conference
* thesis
* description on web
* talking to outsider without an NDA
* showing prototype publically

### Filing 
Priority filing ~12 months:
consistes of priority document and priority date.
1 year to complete filing in other countries, as they will recognise the priority date.
E.g. in Germany, after 18 months the patent is published publically.
After several further checks (notice of allowance and acceptance) the patent may then be complete.
Validation in select EPC countries. Patent granted and maintained in each country as you propose.

PCT filing allows you to reserve most of the world with rights to 

Priority filing 0 month
PCT filing 12 month
Int search report 16 month 
Int publication 18 month
Nat/reg phased 30 month
National examination for each country.
Validity ~20 years from priority filing date.

## Examples 
Europe - EPO
Munich - 
US - USPTO

### Patent extensions
US example, Hatch-Waxman (Roche vs Bolar) drug companies.
A generic was prepared for the time of protection lapse.
The law was ammended such that research could be conducted on a patented drug to be ready for the protection end-date. 

The same equivalent exist for Europe. 
Supplementary protection certificate (SPC).

Patent term restoration up to 5 years.
If less than 5yr from priority date to MA, no SPC is available. 
If more than 5yr you may extend, etc.

### Types of invention / claims
* Methods or product claim 
* product-by-process clains
* Markrush claim (multiple functionally equivalent chemical entities, but not too generic).
* Swiss-type-claim - cover the first, second, or subsequent medical use (like Viagra).
* computer-implemented invention, AI - this can be patented, e.g. AI for monitoring heart is the same as any other patented device basically. 


### Dolly example
1. claim the method (cloning)
	- US Yes
	- EP Yes
2. claim the product (the sheep)
	- US Not
	- EP Yes

### Qs.

* Can I demonstrate prototypes that technically equivillent but appear to be completely different to anyone else?
* Is there a sharehold system for patents - i.e. selling a license?
* Can I license a product which can be bought for commercial use, or improved by the purchaser?
* Can I allow researchers (non-commercial) use the idea licence without restriction.

## Intellectual Property Presented by: Bojana Portmann, AVP IP and Business Development at AC Immune, Lausanne, Vaud, Switzerland.

* This lecture is a summary of the video lecture "Intellectual Property IP: E4L22_IP_Bojana1"

## Video lecture
Bojana Portmann, AVP IP and Business Development at AC Immune, Switzerland. 
AC immune targets neurodegenerative disease. 
Listed since 2017 NASDAQ: ACUI. 
Innovation park Lausanne, 145 employees.
3 billion CHF from their five major investor pharma companies.

* SupraAntigen (vaccines and Abs) lysosomal vehicles on which the antigen is loaded outside, either as a vaccine or used to produce mAb. 
* Morphomer (small molecules)
* Approx 10 drugs with trials, up to phase III,
including NLRP3-ASC treatment.

IP is the most valuable income for AC immune. 
Partners are buying in to their patents. 
* Patents
* Trademarks
* Trade secrets
* Copyrights

> "Defending the patent is as important as the molecule, per se".

Partnering opportunities wanted from pharma
* Decisive attributes
	- high unmet need
	- novel target (first, best)
	- change in standard of care
	- solid IP
* Differentiating attributes
	- strong pre-clinical package with info on MoA
	- predictable PK, dose selection
	- tolerability, convenience
	- clinical efficacy, stage of development

When:
* PCT filing is due 12 month from application - so too early won't work. 
* PCT application publish 18 moth after application.
* Public disclosures, presentations, you must file first as it is no longer and cannot be patented. 

Where:
* National patent offices
	- national application
* European patent office (EPO)
	- priority applcaition, European patent applicaiton
* Patent cooperation treaty (PCT)
	- priority application, international phase, national phase

Freedom to operate (FTO)
* A legal assessment.
* No risk of any infringing patents or IP rights help by other parties.
* FTO search of patent literature.
* If there is FTO concern: design around, license, third part observation, opposition, invalidation.
* Identify potential infringers.

Bolar exemption:
* Other cans work patented molecules and submit regulatory approval before a patent is 
* Research exemption also applied - publish in even patent again in future. 
* Cannot use a patented molecule as a tool in your own screening. 

Examples:
* One Ab for a disease, can be used to test as treating a new disease - Yes
* He must as a CRO to produce that drug for him, but only in small amounts - Yes.
* His colleague wants to use the drug as a test in his research question assays - No.

SPC is a patent extention time (~5 years) for drugs since they can only get market protection (EMA) once market approval is granted. MA could have taken 12 years, therefore the original patent protection time is already 50% lapsed.


* Align IP strategy with Company stratefy
* Generic attacks are inevitable

### Qs
Q. if we are a small group and we find that a big company has infringed our patent - legal action will probably be more than our finance allows. 
Q. if we are a small startup with IP help from EPFL, would AC immune agree on a licence for data/tool that will improve your pipeline?
Q. Would AC immune buy or license data which does not have IP but is private? Statistically robust MoA data but untested.
Example for NLRP3 we could offer list of known pathogenic variants, populations at risk, prior probability of clinical presentation, etc.

Q. As a product emerges how much concrete scientific data is required to begin the IP process. Do you ever begin during the theory stage? 
A. PCT filing is due 12 month from application - so too early won't work. 

Q. We try to do 100% open source science. How exact does publication need to be before it prevents patenting? 
	- e.g. we will make an anti-Tau Ab for the treatment of Alzheimer's which targets antigens that are especially important.
	- do you need to say the exact target, purification protocol, etc, or is simply stating an overview considered prior-art? 
	- a protocol for detecting optimal targets in Tau, versus the same protcol to detect targets on NLRP3? 
	- can I say I am making an Ab which targets a propriatary epitope which was found using the following method?

Q. Review of competing IP is critical. How do you research for open-source alternatives as prior art? Publication-based?

### 5 phases of management
* Project Initiation
* Project Planning
* Project Execution
* Project Monitoring & Control
* Project Closure



* Project is mainly driven by the risk assessment (RA).
	- start with RA and ends when risk has been assessed.

* The audit will be on operation management, not project management.

* 9 key areas of project management plan (PMP)
* [Knowledge areas vs process](knowledge_vs_process.png)
* Product life-cycle - 2 good models
	- waterfall (close the gate on completed parts because it will keep downstream parts in order).
	- v model after the development plan, the input will be defined, everything else after this is just for fulfilling the input requirements (at every step what you wanted to do is now done). Varification and validation.

The user needs is quantified statistically, not just what you predict.
The same with tooling, production. 

Design control is major - changing "one screw" requires so much justification documentation that you must be sure, the boss wants to rush development/market, but the manager must know that these corrections will catch up with us later and become major costs.

* Feasibility study
* Requirements
* Development
* Manufactoring

### 3 main documents 
1. User requirement/needs - the top document with summarative validation at the end.
2. Risk assessment - at start you must say what could fail at end, during production the engineers must define what could fail, in market you assess whether the original assessment was OK and correct based on the prediction/outcome, close those that are complete and address those that are open.
3. Regulatory framework - You already see these in you risk analysis from the beginning, if assessed risk correctly 80% will have been covered, the specific use case or specific norms will be covered. Example [ISO 82304 for software](https://www.iso.org/standard/59543.html).

### Manufacturing
The documentation you give for manufact should be very good. 
Do not rush into this because it is major.
Some manufactures will give input on how things can improve.

Reduce the risk and then reduce the cost.

Ask the members to "close the conflict now", figure it out and move ahead.
