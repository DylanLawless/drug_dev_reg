("Fon jeet" - French pronounciatiion)
* How CH is supporting start up 
	- Federal level InnoSuisse <https://www.innosuisse.ch/inno/en/home.html>
		* coaches paids
		* free training through "venture training" 5 days immersion
		* RandD projects cofinanced by innosuisse with an academic partner, pays up to 1m, IP belongs to startup.
		* Never receive cash this way (2 eceptions Swissair, and UBS). Instad with indirect suport funding.
	- Regional level, verious. e.g. Platin <https://platinn.ch>
	- Local cantonoal level, can provide cash, fierce compotion, some up to 400K (e.g. DeLomont, in Geneva all subsidies go to Fongit for them to provide incubation - lab space, servicees, legal, IP, a little cash ~20K, etc.) Fund innovation avail. Innovaud <https://www.innovaud.ch/en/>.

The VC shareholders will likely own approx. 10-30% - I think this is incorrect.

* The founder should have at least 30% to prove their commitment (German style). In romantic countries there is less importance on that. 
* Milestones, buybacks, and relution (give back shares to investor) to motivate founder.
* Innosuisse says from 350 companies ready to launch, sales and profit projection estimate for 2years versus real turnover - ratio is 10:1. 

* Compared to tech, biotech has far more % failure.
* Greater cost of path to market.
* Greater value of successful product.
* Exit and IPO pre-prod launch.

* KOL - key opinion leaders are important investors on board of deirectors: know who to know.
* FUnders will try to get exclusivity at beginning - fight this. Ensure possiblity to buy back shares.


Main invest criteria:
* Management team 40% who is there (2-3 person much more successful that single. Is there gender balance with women at top)
* Product service 2_%
* Market and comp 10%
* Business model 10%
* Finanace and regulatory 20%

### Intersting notes
* This is "the one website to know" the main business Angel club, VC by industry <https://www.startupticker.ch/en/news>.
* E.g. Itallian VC will require you to set up an Italian subsiduary because they require to spend their money in EU. Keep the mother company in CH for sale tax (zero).

### Qs.
Is there a minimum speed, like academic age.
Share holders will own 10-30%. Is there a % maximum at first production/commercialisation.
Answered above.

* Note on what are Notified Bodies <https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/goods/building-blocks/notified-bodies_en>
* BSI is head of notified bodies for devices in EU <https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/medical-devices/our-services/What-is-the-role-of-the-notified-body/>


* Change from 3 EU directive to 2 regulations EU/2017/745 and EU/2017/746.
* The general principles are listed in slides.
* Transitioned from AIMD and MDD -> MDR (medical devices regulation) and the old IVD directive (IVDD) has become the IVDR (regulation).

* Most devices can be registered with a single "notified body".
* But complex companies might deal with different notified bodies.
* Notified bodies are audited by each countries' audit teams in EU.

* CH broke off EU negotiations in May 2021 -> a "third country" for MDR and IVDR. Anything with CE mark (sold in EU) cannot just be sold in CH, must also go through the notification body and have a legal representive in both EU and CH.
* UK is also a "third country".

* Before IVDD because IVDR, only a small number 20% required notified body involvement, but not it is around 80% of devices that require notified body.

* NB: "clinical investigation"regulated at national level so each country requires each national compotent authorities.
* A recall would reuire contacting all 27 national authorities (the contact person's info is kept on your desk!).

* Make sure you will get reimbursement - the therapy or device can be reinburesed from each country, this takes a lot of time to make sure it is correct for the tax payers to cover. (like MediCare). Example an isulin pump in CH tooks 4 years. Refused in France because not enough evidence of social benefit. e.g. bound by requirement to show social economic benifit for ten years.This process is very legal and statistical.

* New MDR: medical devices must comply with MDR-annex I: GSPRs
	- 23 genoeral safety and performance requirements
	- Chp I general
	- Chp II requirements of design and manufact
	- Chp III info to be supplies (labeling, instrutions, etc.)

* Complicance with GSPRs - 3 pillars
	- pillar 1. technical (hardware, software)
	- pillar 2. biological (safe materials, contact with body, etc)
	- pillar 3. cinical (sufficient clinical evidence, postmarket)

* Fulfill  GSPR through fulfilling international standards:
	- Demonstrate complience (IEC and ISO, both in Geneva CH, ASDM america).
	- if you comply with their standards it make life easier to demonstrating safety to notified bodies.

* FDA has a good database of consensus standards
<https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm>
- notified body will tell you which standard will apply to your device.
* Make your list of stands - the ISOs and start complying and be ready to start buying them ASAP; 1k-150K depending on the test.



## Qs
Regulation is required to sell - can be give software to early users before regulation? - Yes, OK and a good idea. 
Cost of getting notified - do we need to pay for notified body work, the autits, etc.  or the auditing country?
The cost is relatively low between 2-5K.

## Interesting notes
Look for a notified body early on as they can be very helpful at the start. Officially they cannot consult but they may say "in other companies I have seen this.. " and they can look at your new device and give some advice.
For the FDA, pre-market may be required for some quite new devices and this would be 250K but may be free for new company.

HTA is done only around ph 2, ph 3, <https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-technology-assessment>.
