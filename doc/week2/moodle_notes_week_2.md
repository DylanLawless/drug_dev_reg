# Moodle notes Week 2

Hello,

Welcome to week 2.

**Before we begin, we would like to summarize Week 1:**

**The slide deck covering drug development is self-explanatory 02\_E4L\_Week1\_DrugDevProc\_DRUGS\_20220506\_GM.pptx, EU Clinical Trial Regulation and preclinical sections are covered live, rest will be covered through Thursday lectures.**

**Preclinical section is covered mainly by the ICH guidance: [M3_R2_ Step 4 June 11 2009 (ich.org)](https://database.ich.org/sites/default/files/M3_R2__Guideline.pdf)

**gCMC is covered mainly by: [Requirements to the chemical and pharmaceutical quality documentation concerning investigational medicinal products in clinical trials - Rev. 2 (europa.eu)**](https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-02/mp_eudralex_guideline-chemical_en_1.pdf)

**gClinical Trial Design: [Master Protocols to Study Multiple Therapies, Multiple Diseases, or Both | NEJM**](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmra1510062)

**gMoodle: Teams and Team leaders have been defined. Please check Moodle! We expect team leaders to work with us to upload the Project Description and Template into Moodle by September 1, 2022. Groups A and C are done.**

This week we will deal with medical device (MedTech) development process. In simple words a medical device prevents, diagnoses, treats or cures a disease without reacting with the body chemically, immunologically, or neurologically to achieve the intended purpose. The reaction is simply physical or mechanical.

Section 201(h) of the Federal Food Drug & Cosmetic (FD&C) Act defines a device as an "instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part, or accessory which is:

* recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopoeia, or any supplement to them
* Intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, *or*
* Intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and

which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of humans or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes. The term 'device' does not include software functions excluded pursuant to section 520(o).

European Union

The overarching legislation for medical devices in the European Union in Regulation (EU) 2017/745. In this Regulation a medical device is defined as follows :

‘medical device’ means any instrument, apparatus, appliance, software, implant, reagent, material or other article intended by the manufacturer to be used, alone or in combination, for human beings for one or more of the following specific medical purposes:

* diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, prediction, prognosis, treatment or alleviation of disease,
* diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of, or compensation for, an injury or disability,
* investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological or pathological process or state,
* providing information by means of in vitro examination of specimens derived from the human body, including organ, blood and tissue donations,

and which does not achieve its principal intended action by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, in or on the human body, but which may be assisted in its function by such means.

The following products shall also be deemed to be medical devices:
* devices for the control or support of conception;
* products specifically intended for the cleaning, disinfection or sterilization of devices.

There is a separate Regulation for In Vitro diagnostic medical devices: (EU) 2017/746.

**European Commission, European Council, and European Parliament**

* Are responsible for developing and approving all European Union legislation (Directives, Regulations, Decisions, Acts)
* Are responsible for ensuring the consistent implementation thereof in the EU Member States

**National Competent Authorities**

* Have the ultimate responsibility for protecting public health in their country.
* Have the authority over clinical investigations with medical devices in their country.
* Have the authority over any adverse events and related “field safety corrective actions” (sometimes simply referred to as “product recalls”) in their country.
* Have certain administrative functions, as applicable (e.g., registration of manufacturers, registration of certain devices)

**Notified Bodies**

* Evaluate the conformity of a manufacturer’s Quality Management System with the requirements of the MDR and IVDR. This is usually done by periodically (annually) performing on-site quality audits as well as unannounced audits.
* Evaluate the conformity of a manufacturer’s medical devices by reviewing the manufacturer’s Technical Documentation for said devices or by performing Type Tests of said devices.
* Issue EU Certificates for a manufacturer’s Quality Management System and the devices covered by that System 

Here are two additional links which is useful to go through:

* Something to think about, this was in Washington Post on September 4, 2021: “A mystery sits at the heart of the economic recovery: There are 10 million job openings, yet more than 8.4 million unemployed are still actively looking for work.

* The job market looks, in some ways, like a boom-time situation. Business owners complain they can’t find enough workers, pay is rising rapidly, and customers are greeted with “please be patient, we’re short-staffed”

Thank you.
