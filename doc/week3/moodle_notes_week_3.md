ROLE OF QUALITY COMPLIANCE IN THE REGULATED INDUSTRY

Hello,

Welcome to Week 3 - Role of Quality Compliance in the Regulated Industry

Pharmaceutical quality is **the foundation that allows patients and consumers to have confidence in the safety and effectiveness of their medications**. Quality is defined to meet the need of the consumer.

Here are three concrete examples where quality assurance failed to ensure safety and efficacy:

* An untrained cleaner used the same mop to clean the office and the sterile manufacturing facility. Result was that the product was contaminated and rejected.
* Manager did not ensure the control of humidity of the ambient air while manufacturing of a capsule product containing powder for inhalation. The powder stuck to the walls of the capsule and was not delivered during administration to patients. This led to heavy cost in investment, rejection of the batch and harm to patient.
* An inspector detected with a bubble-meter that the dissolution apparatus in different places in the manufacturing facility were not placed horizontal. This resulted in a warning letter to the company by the Agency because the results were not consistent.

Quality culture plays a significant role in ensuring that an effective Quality System is in place within an organization. Establishing a quality culture takes time and commitment across the organization. In many cases it involves changing the mind-set of a pharmaceutical organization from a compliance-led culture to an excellence-led culture of quality. Culture drives people’s behavior, innovation and customer service.

The actions and behaviors that are displayed at a leadership level play a key role towards the successful implementation of quality culture. It is important for leaders to be seen to demonstrate the following behaviors:

* Visibility (presence and visible management commitment, engaging with employees at all levels within the organization)
* Voice (passion, credibility, clarity, motivation)
* Values (ethics, model behaviors, humility)
* Vision (strategy, unifying goals, plan, mantra)
* Vigilance (accountability, follow through, grit)

Senior management should lead the process for transformational change, dedicate financial and human resources to Quality Improvement (QI), communicate progress, hold staff accountable, address resistance to change, and exhibit visible support for QI.

Middle managers and supervisors should ensure that all employees have the direct support needed and are being held accountable to QI values and behaviors.

Without leadership commitment, progress toward the desired state will diminish and likely result in relapse to the previous state. 

Two terms we hear very often are Quality Control (QC) and Quality Assurance (QA). Here is a simple example to illustrate the difference between QC and QA. When you buy a hamburger, you check the appearance, feel the temperature, the smell, read the label, maybe open a bit to see the content. This is a spot-check. This is QC.

QA is, in addition to spot-check, you enter the restaurant, check the expiry dates of materials, check the temperature of the refrigerator, see if the staff is trained, check if the kitchen is clean, check the period of cleaning etc. QA is focused on the sustainability of quality.


Please feel free to ask questions anytime. No questions can be wrong!
