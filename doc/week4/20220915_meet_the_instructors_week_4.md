## Biotechnology - Virus Filtration Technology updates. Presented by: Lionnel Lueginbuehl, Pall Biotech
Overview of the company and world disrubution.

Typical viral clearance steps (used for mAb, etc.).
Cell harvest, primary stabilisation, UF/DF purification, formulation and filling.

Uses
* Optical clarity
* Particle reduction
* bioburden control 
* sterilisation
* viral filtration

Removal claims
* particle rention claims
* microbial removal claims
* viral retention claims

* Standardised filter composition module.
* PVDF is most common filter membrane. 
* Fan pleat or laid-over please (LOP).
* Surface inhanced substrate.

2 main requirements: retaining the virus and cost-effective before replacing.
Other tech for viral removal include: chromatography, low pH inactivation, pasteurisation, e.g. Several are usually combined for a robust viral removal strategy; "orthogonal step" is required by authorities.

Unlikely centrifugation, filtration is linearly scalable for a growing company.

### Case study
Recieve validation info from the supplier: how to you "Pall" know the filter will work.
Pall will simulate the widest range of conditions. The customer must repeat their own tests to know the product works as expected. 
Impact of depressurisation, or multiple start/stops - all the possible coditions that the customer might use to know what the log reduction virus (LRV) is.

End-user  varification summary is compared to the company's internal testing to show how well the product is working. 

Viral safety requires orthogonal and robust steps.

## Biotechnology - Virus Filtration Technology updates. Presented by: Stijn de Backer, Pall Biotech
Routes of virus contamination; cell manipulation, endogenous, adventagious (columns, plasma media, opporators), non-endogenous (from biobank, etc.).

Virus safety strategies
* Control of raw material (testing, treamtnet).
* Testing (unprocessed or partial process bulk).
* Assess upstream/downstream (chromatog, low pH, etc).

* Screening, inactivation/removal, verification.

### Regulatory guidance overview
ICH Q5A (this one is major), FDAn EMA and USP.
1. Validation study design
2. choice of viruses
3. data interpretation 

When is it performed?
From investigation drug (phase 0 to market phase 4)
* Phase 0 - US 1 study, minimum of 1 virus families which could be present in your product. EMA 2 studies 2 virus, NMPA (China) 1 product lot 2 virus.
* Phase 1 
* Phase 2 
* Phase 3 - US 2 studies 4-5 virus, EMA 2 studies 4-5 virus, NMPA not reg require.

ICH Q5A - choice of virus
* Relevant virus (HIV, HBV, HVC).
* Specific model virus (MuLV, MVM, PPV, BVDV).
* Non-specific model virus (SV40, Sindbis, Polio).

Summary
* Virus safety is a reg reqiurement for all bio derived medicinal prducts.
* Regulatory expection that qulity by design (QbD) is applied to all new bioprocesses.

## Intellectual Property Presented by: Bojana Portmann, AVP IP and Business Development at AC Immune, Lausanne, Vaud, Switzerland.
## Intellectual Property - A key to Innovation - Intellectual Property in the 21st Century Presented by: Natalia Giovannini, Technology Transfer Manager at EPFL.
## US FDA, International Engagement, and the US-EU Mutual Recognition Agreement Presented by: Matthew Scherer, US Food and Drug Administration, Europe Office.

## Video lecture
Bojana Portmann, AVP IP and Business Development at AC Immune, Switzerland. 
AC immune targets neurodegenerative disease. 
Listed since 2017 NASDAQ: ACUI. 
Innovation park Lausanne, 145 employees.

* SupraAntigen (vaccines and Abs) lysosomal vehicles on which the antigen is loaded outside, either as a vaccine or used to produce mAb. 
* Morphomer (small molecules)
* Approx 10 drugs with trials, up to phase III,
including NLRP3-ASC treatment.

IP is the most valuable income for AC immune. 
Partners are buying in to their patents. 
* Patents
* Trademarks
* Trade secrets
* Copyrights

"Defending the patent is as important as the molecule, per se".

Partnering opportunities wanted from pharma
* Decisive attributes
	- high unmet need
	- novel target (first, best)
	- change in standard of care
	- solid IP
* Differentiating attributes
	- strong pre-clinical package with info on MoA
	- predictable PK, dose selection
	- tolerability, convenience
	- clinical efficacy, stage of development

When:
* PCT filing is due 12 month from application - so too early won't work. 
* PCT application publish 18 moth after application.
* Public disclosures, presentations, you must file first as it is no longer and cannot be patented. 

Where:
* National patent offices
	- national application
* European patent office (EPO)
	- priority applcaition, European patent applicaiton
* Patent cooperation treaty (PCT)
	- priority application, international phase, national phase

Freedom to operate (FTO)
* A legal assessment.
* No risk of any infringing patents or IP rights help by other parties.
* FTO search of patent literature.
* If there is FTO concern: design around, license, third part observation, opposition, invalidation.
* Identify potential infringers.

Bolar exemption:
* Other cans work patented molecules and submit regulatory approval before a patent is 
* Research exemption also applied - publish in even patent again in future. 
* Cannot use a patented molecule as a tool in your own screening. 

Examples:
* One Ab for a disease, can be used to test as treating a new disease - Yes
* He must as a CRO to produce that drug for him, but only in small amounts - Yes.
* His colleague wants to use the drug as a test in his research question assays - No.

SPC is a patent extention time (~5 years) for drugs since they can only get market protection (EMA) once market approval is granted. MA could have taken 12 years, therefore the original patent protection time is already 50% lapsed.

### Qs
Q. Would AC immune buy or license data which does not have IP but is private? Statistically robust MoA data but untested.
Example for NLRP3 we could offer list of known pathogenic variants, populations at risk, prior probability of clinical presentation, etc.

Q. As a product emerges how much concrete scientific data is required to begin the IP process. Do you ever begin during the theory stage? 
A. PCT filing is due 12 month from application - so too early won't work. 

Q. We try to do 100% open source science. How exact does publication need to be before it prevents patenting? 
	- e.g. we will make an anti-Tau Ab for the treatment of Alzheimer's which targets antigens that are especially important.
	- do you need to say the exact target, purification protocol, etc, or is simply stating an overview considered prior-art? 
	- a protocol for detecting optimal targets in Tau, versus the same protcol to detect targets on NLRP3? 
	- can I say I am making an Ab which targets a propriatary epitope which was found using the following method?

Q. Review of competing IP is critical. How do you research for open-source alternatives as prior art? Publication-based?


## Video lecture Shannon Thor, deputy director FDA Europe.
Mutual recognition agreement (MRA) on pharmaceutical GMP 2017. 
FDA and EU can rely on each other's human drug Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) inspections.
They cooperate with EC and EU-MS (Europe and member states), support goals at International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF), monitor MDR and IVDR developments.

* EMA Europe - FDA, Confidentiality Commitment
<https://www.fda.gov/international-programs/confidentiality-commitments/ema-europe-fda-confidentiality-commitment>

Ways they collaborate
* MRA
* Clusters (groups for areas of interest)
* Fellowships (2 week EMA/FDA exchange on topics)
* Parallel scientific advice (PSA)

PSA inscreases dialog and avoids unnecessary testing.
Best candidates for PSA: products for unmet needs, those which have differet guidelines outside the norm.
PSA is voluntary at request of sponsor. 
Question of product development put both to EMA and FDA.
PSA may not be guranteed.
Each agency can be consulted individually.

Protocol
* Reciew of scientific questions
* bilateral meeting (EMA, FDA)
* trilateral meeting (EMA, FDA, sponsor)
* Issue feedback to sponsor (individual agency)

PSA Length 75-95 days.

## In-person (zoom) lecture Shannon Thor, deputy director FDA Europe.
Same content as the video lecture.

In EU the company must have GMP for production- US does not have this requirement yet and may be slow to ever implrement it.
