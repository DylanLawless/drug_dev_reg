## Biotechnology - Virus Filtration Technology updates. Presented by: Lionnel Lueginbuehl, Pall Biotech
Overview of the company and world disrubution.

Typical viral clearance steps (used for mAb, etc.).
Cell harvest, primary stabilisation, UF/DF purification, formulation and filling.

Uses
* Optical clarity
* Particle reduction
* bioburden control 
* sterilisation
* viral filtration

Removal claims
* particle rention claims
* microbial removal claims
* viral retention claims

* Standardised filter composition module.
* PVDF is most common filter membrane. 
* Fan pleat or laid-over please (LOP).
* Surface inhanced substrate.

2 main requirements: retaining the virus and cost-effective before replacing.
Other tech for viral removal include: chromatography, low pH inactivation, pasteurisation, e.g. Several are usually combined for a robust viral removal strategy; "orthogonal step" is required by authorities.

Unlikely centrifugation, filtration is linearly scalable for a growing company.

### Case study
Recieve validation info from the supplier: how to you "Pall" know the filter will work.
Pall will simulate the widest range of conditions. The customer must repeat their own tests to know the product works as expected. 
Impact of depressurisation, or multiple start/stops - all the possible coditions that the customer might use to know what the log reduction virus (LRV) is.

End-user  varification summary is compared to the company's internal testing to show how well the product is working. 

Viral safety requires orthogonal and robust steps.

## Biotechnology - Virus Filtration Technology updates. Presented by: Stijn de Backer, Pall Biotech
Routes of virus contamination; cell manipulation, endogenous, adventagious (columns, plasma media, opporators), non-endogenous (from biobank, etc.).

Virus safety strategies
* Control of raw material (testing, treamtnet).
* Testing (unprocessed or partial process bulk).
* Assess upstream/downstream (chromatog, low pH, etc).

* Screening, inactivation/removal, verification.

### Regulatory guidance overview
ICH Q5A (this one is major), FDAn EMA and USP.
1. Validation study design
2. choice of viruses
3. data interpretation 

When is it performed?
From investigation drug (phase 0 to market phase 4)
* Phase 0 - US 1 study, minimum of 1 virus families which could be present in your product. EMA 2 studies 2 virus, NMPA (China) 1 product lot 2 virus.
* Phase 1 
* Phase 2 
* Phase 3 - US 2 studies 4-5 virus, EMA 2 studies 4-5 virus, NMPA not reg require.

ICH Q5A - choice of virus
* Relevant virus (HIV, HBV, HVC).
* Specific model virus (MuLV, MVM, PPV, BVDV).
* Non-specific model virus (SV40, Sindbis, Polio).

Summary
* Virus safety is a reg reqiurement for all bio derived medicinal prducts.
* Regulatory expection that qulity by design (QbD) is applied to all new bioprocesses.

## US FDA, International Engagement, and the US-EU Mutual Recognition Agreement Presented by: Matthew Scherer, US Food and Drug Administration, Europe Office.


## Video lecture Shannon Thor, deputy director FDA Europe.
Mutual recognition agreement (MRA) on pharmaceutical GMP 2017. 
FDA and EU can rely on each other's human drug Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) inspections.
They cooperate with EC and EU-MS (Europe and member states), support goals at International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF), monitor MDR and IVDR developments.

* EMA Europe - FDA, Confidentiality Commitment
<https://www.fda.gov/international-programs/confidentiality-commitments/ema-europe-fda-confidentiality-commitment>

Ways they collaborate
* MRA
* Clusters (groups for areas of interest)
* Fellowships (2 week EMA/FDA exchange on topics)
* Parallel scientific advice (PSA)

PSA inscreases dialog and avoids unnecessary testing.
Best candidates for PSA: products for unmet needs, those which have differet guidelines outside the norm.
PSA is voluntary at request of sponsor. 
Question of product development put both to EMA and FDA.
PSA may not be guranteed.
Each agency can be consulted individually.

Protocol
* Reciew of scientific questions
* bilateral meeting (EMA, FDA)
* trilateral meeting (EMA, FDA, sponsor)
* Issue feedback to sponsor (individual agency)

PSA Length 75-95 days.

## In-person (zoom) lecture Shannon Thor, deputy director FDA Europe.
Same content as the video lecture.

In EU the company must have GMP for production- US does not have this requirement yet and may be slow to ever implrement it. 

## Onsite today
Prof. Johannes Streffer CMO of ACImmune.
