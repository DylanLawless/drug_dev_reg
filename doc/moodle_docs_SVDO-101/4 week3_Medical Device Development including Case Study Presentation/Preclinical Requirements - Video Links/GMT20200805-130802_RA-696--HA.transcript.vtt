00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.719
Gautam Maitra: Please go ahead, yes

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.429
Haddouk: Hello.

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.870
Haddouk: First of all, I'm very pleased to join this educational programs so that may introduce myself.

4
00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.940
Haddouk: My name is Hasnaa Haddouk. I'm the head of preclinical safety and biological sciences in SOBI in Geneva.

5
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.670
Haddouk: And I'm very pleased here to participate. And to give you an overview on non clinical safety and translational  aspects.

6
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:35.430
Haddouk: With a comparison between small molecules, and biologics. So during this presentation.

7
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:55.560
Haddouk: I will give you an overview of the requirements in terms of non clinical safety before entering human and even for later stages and also some translation and aspects which are important in the transition from a non clinical to clinical studies and

8
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:06.990
Haddouk: In this also give an example and the case study. So let's do it in two parts in the first part we will focus mainly on the non clinical safety in drug development.

9
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:24.060
Haddouk: So we will try to answer here. What are why we do include safety and also when and what. so for the why we need a non clinical safety assessments.

10
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:34.410
Haddouk: Well, first of all, to characterize the toxic effects of the compound we need to understand about the time the target organs.

11
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:43.170
Haddouk: Those dependency and relationship to exposure and also if there is any finding if this finding is reversible or not.

12
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:55.620
Haddouk: And the reason for this is that this is very important to estimate the initial safe dose for phase one. Before you start, and you start any study clinical study in humans.

13
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:09.690
Haddouk: And then also to identify the subsequent dose escalations scheme because depending on the finding and the severity will have within the non technical talks studies, you might have to follow different

14
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:31.080
Haddouk: diagram of escalation in one run independent studies. The first in man and also to identify more importantly to identify the biomarkers enter for Pharmacology and Toxicology aspects that you ideally would be

15
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:48.630
Haddouk: Managed in the same manner or followed in the manner will be coming to the non clinical spaces and true to the human. This will allow you to better monitor for toxicology aspects but, as well as the one who are lucky for some pharmacological activities.

16
00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:03.270
Haddouk: Sometimes we can also face some safety concerns that you might have. But these are not necessarily linked to the intrinsic properties of the compound, you want to test

17
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:13.800
Haddouk: But this can be related to the quality of the investigation medicinal product you use and linked to the, let's say, to the process of manufacturing

18
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:25.410
Haddouk: And this also. But it's not out of the scope of the presentation and given here. But it's a it also might result in some safety concern and you have to ensure during your clinical

19
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:50.460
Haddouk: Testing that you use a compound to have a good quality to ensure that any results in mind of the clinical trial is not an affected by in appropriate to safety, quality or efficacy, which might come from unsatisfactory manufacturer of the compound linked to any impurity or or other issues.

20
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.670
Haddouk: Then

21
00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:02.040
Haddouk: For the question, when can we have way to start. And when do we run on clinical safety package.

22
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:17.910
Haddouk: So usually I would say there is a distinction to have between one we say preclinical and non clinical so for me preclinical studies is the minimum package that you have to run before you go into phase one studies.

23
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:39.180
Haddouk: This hour we will go through them in more detail later. It is quite limited number of studies which have to be done before you start phase one. However, it does not mean that all is done because, of course, many other studies and they prefer the term non clinical because this other although

24
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.390
Haddouk: During Phase one, two and three and

25
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:56.190
Haddouk: Sometimes even beyond older studies to complete the full package before you go for biology biology license on you drag application or a MAA. When you are in Europe.

26
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.170
Haddouk: So,

27
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:11.970
Haddouk: Then for the nature of the studies that you have to run. So it's quite, it has to cover different aspects that you might face with your compound.

28
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:29.430
Haddouk: First you have to have an idea of what we call the safety pharmacology studies which are exaggerated pharmacology effect what that you might see not at very high level on your compound, but rather as those which are close to the pharmacological on these

29
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:42.660
Haddouk: Multiples but with lower range compared to the pharmacological those you will use in the clinical studies and here you focus mainly on the on the main

30
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:53.490
Haddouk: Organs and safety aspects related to the central nervous system to cardiovascular or respiratory effects which might be having impact, which is

31
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.580
Haddouk: Might be very vital for the for the patients or the healthy volunteer.

32
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.500
Haddouk: You have also to cover multiple the

33
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:16.290
Haddouk: faults of the of the pharmacological dose you target in human and to cover them in toxicology studies because you need to understand what is your target organ.

34
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:26.100
Haddouk: For toxicity to be in a better position to follow any science and findings for this during the clinical studies.

35
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:37.710
Haddouk: You also, of course, during this toxicology studies have to run the toxicokinetic and non Clinical Pharmacogenetics. Is that is to to to to have a better picture of the

36
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:52.680
Haddouk: Of the how real compound and how your body. I would say behaves with the handling the compounds that does it have a long half life or short half life. Is there any accumulation within the

37
00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:04.470
Haddouk: Related to the exposure or in the opposite. Is there any clearance of your compound which is which become more important when you increase the dose. Sometimes it can happen as well.

38
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.400
Haddouk: Of course, you have to cover

39
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.600
Haddouk: In addition to all the toxicology.

40
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:25.350
Haddouk: Aspects within the general toxicology studies have to run very specific studies related to development and repro-toxicity studies that we call here under developed DART

41
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.580
Haddouk: Because that's usually called DART studies.

42
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.930
Haddouk: You also need to assess if your compound.

43
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:55.860
Haddouk: How can have bring any risk related to genotoxicity. Does it and act or has any effect on the DNA either via direct interaction or by and direct interaction through the disturbance of the spindle refresh operations, for example.

44
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.410
Haddouk: Sorry, the spindle.

45
00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.940
Haddouk: Which might result in chromosome elaboration on angiogenic effects.

46
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:15.960
Haddouk: Later on, you also have to consider if there is a need for running depending of course on the

47
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:39.090
Haddouk: On the indication of your compound and the treatment duration, you use for the compound. If you need any carcinogenic potential assessments with your compound unless it is proven to be genotoxic. And in that case, you might not have to run a carcinogen is carcinogenic study

48
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:50.280
Haddouk: Of course, and on a case by case basis, you might still have to run other non clinical studies, maybe we can cover some examples. 

49
00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:10.050
Haddouk: So for toxicology, I would say, by experience I have worked in in different area and small molecules and biologics, and the profile of the studies and you will run with the difference, depending on the

50
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:27.510
Haddouk: Molecule you're working on, let's call it to SME for the small molecule entity and the biological I have given here an example of an antibody, which is even be specific activity, but you can have different kinds of biologics and

51
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:46.950
Haddouk: I would say we should better represent it in this way because the biologic first tractor is completely different from small molecule and therefore based on this. You have to adapt also to take into account, many considerations.

52
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.060
Haddouk: Because because of this difference in size.

53
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:58.440
Haddouk: Target toxicity will target organ might be different and also the

54
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:06.270
Haddouk: preclinical package or the non clinical package that you have to run for the development of your compound will be also difference

55
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:24.210
Haddouk: And here I will try to list the key factors that has to be considered when you and to explain why it is difference between small molecules and large molecules and typically

56
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:36.630
Haddouk: Because of the manufacturing process which is different, small market is usually done by chemical sentences manufacturer with it's not the case for the the biology synthesis.

57
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:48.600
Haddouk: The molecular weight is by far high for the biologics, and therefore also the nature of the compound, because the small molecules

58
00:10:50.070 --> 00:11:02.670
Haddouk: When they go they enter the body. They go through metabolism process which will involve phase one and phase two enzymes and results potentially in

59
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:13.050
Haddouk: In metabolites, different types of metabolize sometimes depending on the spaces and also different amounts of metabolites.

60
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.620
Haddouk: Also for the

61
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:32.040
Haddouk: However, on the other hand for the biologics, I would say it's more the catabolism the metabolism and the at the end product is more amino acids which going to enter into the turnover on the body so

62
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:37.950
Haddouk: In this is a main difference between both compounds that has to be taken into account.

63
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:54.180
Haddouk: And also because of the size it is highly distributed in the body for the small molecules and which is definitely not the case for the antibodies, for example, which is poorly distributed and which staying in the main

64
00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:14.160
Haddouk: In the blood compartments and very limited area which is different from the small molecules and for this moment because it also depends on the lipophilic status of the compound, the more it's lipophilic the more to go deep in the in the organs and

65
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.270
Haddouk: The higher to stay in the body as well.

66
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:34.590
Haddouk: Of course, depending on the distribution and the lipophilicity and the metabolism or not sort of a compound the the half life will be

67
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:53.460
Haddouk: Different and typically the small molecule is our definition has half lives in general, which is counted in hours rather for the antibodies. They have read a long half life which is goes from hours for some small not activities but

68
00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:01.350
Haddouk: Proteins and the and which go two weeks for some antibiotics.

69
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.070
Haddouk: Usually the

70
00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.470
Haddouk: Administration.

71
00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:22.680
Haddouk: Targeted administration, both in for the clinical studies and for the therapeutic use is usually oral for the small molecules and it's in general it's under IV subcutaneous and intramuscular for the biologics

72
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:42.780
Haddouk: And this also will impact many aspects for the distribution and for the compounds and it is very rarely very specific specific for the small molecules and it is usually and if it's not often the case specificity specific for the the antibodies

73
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:52.320
Haddouk: Therefore, because of all these consideration, you might because of higher distribution higher

74
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.630
Haddouk: Possibility for generating the reactive metabolites.

75
00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:00.120
Haddouk: Because of

76
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:25.410
Haddouk: lack of specificity compared to the biologics. The small molecules were results usually  in more off target toxicity and usually the main target organ is the liver because of the metabolism and the turnover and which is of higher rating the liver for the biologics

77
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:37.590
Haddouk: You have cases where you have off target toxicity, of course, but the main effects you see is more what we call exaggerated pharmacology.

78
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:52.680
Haddouk: Which is usually related related to the to the pharmacological activity of the compound. So you need for the biologics to have very good understanding of the pharmacology for the design of your non clinical studies.

79
00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.690
Haddouk: So if we consider, as I said before, for the metabolism. The for the

80
00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:15.300
Haddouk: Antibodies in the it results in within blocks of in amino acids with no intrinsic toxicity. I would say for the small molecules here. It's an example for the acetaminophen.

81
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:38.910
Haddouk: And it goes through phase one, and afterwards in phase two metabolism, but in phase one and there is a some and hydroxyl ation which will result in reactive metabolites that is not your active metabolites that you want to have a having the pharmacological effect. But if there is any

82
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:56.790
Haddouk: Accumulation of the compound and saturation of the face two metabolism, which is happening for the elimination of the compound, you might result in the reactive metabolites accumulating in the body and resulting in toxicities specifically in this case in the liver.

83
00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:03.060
Haddouk: And this such situation will not happen with the biologics, of course.

84
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:20.040
Haddouk: The same for access to DNA and micro molecules because of the limitation of the access in general to the membrane to DNA and micro medical and this is not applicable for the bio for the antibodies

85
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:32.490
Haddouk: However, it can be a big concern for small molecules which can result sometimes depending either as a metabolite or other component, the parent compound itself in the

86
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:45.060
Haddouk: In gene mutation or chromosomal aberrations and this is definitely something we don't want to follow up on with the compound, usually it's a killer for components.

87
00:16:50.190 --> 00:17:07.920
Haddouk: Also for what is related to cardiac safety small molecules are specifically compounds which have lipophillic characteristics can result in an interaction with with what we call the hERG channel and

88
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:12.330
Haddouk: Which which might results in the

89
00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:29.370
Haddouk: What we call the QT prolongation and which is in the ECG, and for this QT , it can lead to delayed repolarization of the ventricles and the ultimate results will be that

90
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:47.160
Haddouk: It results in what we call the tops of the plant and and can lead to some very high risk in terms of cardiac safety and this is definitely not a concern for biologic

91
00:17:48.300 --> 00:18:00.240
Haddouk: If there is any effects on jack activity. It might be an direct but it will never be direct because of the interaction of the with the hERG Channel.

92
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:11.010
Haddouk: On the other hand, for immunogenicity. It does not mean that for small molecules. You cannot have some

93
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:21.150
Haddouk: immune reaction of your body against the drug. It might happen, especially if they are linked to other

94
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:44.010
Haddouk: protein or cellulite compartments in the in the body, but the main concern you have in terms of reaction against your, your drug is the link to the biologics because they have, of course, definitely higher concern potential of inducing antibodies against

95
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:52.110
Haddouk: Against them in and compared to the small molecules. And in that case, you might results in

96
00:18:53.550 --> 00:19:01.200
Haddouk: What we call ADA antibody drag antibodies which can lead to a potential side effects.

97
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:16.230
Haddouk: In the worst case scenario or at minimum, you will have higher clearance, because these are neutralizing antibodies of your compound and therefore you can def there. Therefore, you can have a lack of

98
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:22.740
Haddouk: Efficacy of your components because you lose exposure to your components.

99
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:49.410
Haddouk: In general, as I said before that, for the biologic to the pharmacology of the biology will usually determines the toxicity profile of your compound as it's named exaggerated pharmacology and

100
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:52.680
Haddouk: However, sometimes you can

101
00:19:53.970 --> 00:20:01.440
Haddouk: End up having false positive, because you have not used the relevant spaces in non clinical assessment.

102
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:13.080
Haddouk: Or because the antibody results in immunogenicity reaction against human activity because now we are more and more generated fully human antibodies

103
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:29.640
Haddouk: When you administer them to the non clinical species you will result in a reaction against that antibody that it's not so relevant and representative for the human situation. So that will result in anaphylactic reactions and which will be

104
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.270
Haddouk: Which will give you a false positive.

105
00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:44.640
Haddouk: Results, which might not be relevant for the human situation. On the other hand, you can also face negative false negative. Sorry.

106
00:20:46.710 --> 00:21:05.100
Haddouk: Results in the non clinical spaces, simply because you have a target antigen and negative spaces for this target antigen and therefore you are not able, in that case to detect the exaggerated pharmacology in your non clinical species.

107
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:20.220
Haddouk: So when we come back to the small molecules. So, this is the list. I have given before for the clinical toxicology studies that sorry non clinical toxicologist studies that you have to run

108
00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:37.470
Haddouk: Around compound. So for the small molecules, you will have for the pharmacology studies, you will have this includes a package of in vitro and individual assessments in vitro for the hERG channel, and then you do in vivo studies.

109
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:45.360
Haddouk: Independent standalone studies for the assessment of the respiratory cardiac safety and

110
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:54.180
Haddouk: And sometimes additional motility, etc. Which which which is more related to safety pharmacology. In that case,

111
00:21:54.840 --> 00:22:05.790
Haddouk: You also have to run the of course the toxicology studies. And for this you need to use two different species one rodents and one more than species.

112
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:16.530
Haddouk: And the selection of which this is you have to use is usually based on the metabolism profile that you have run before in-vitro to compare the different species and your

113
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:27.900
Haddouk: Tox species have to cover all the metabolites, you have generated with the compound, you are supposed to have to generate the with the compound with the human

114
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:38.250
Haddouk: For this you do screening before using the in vitro testing, of course, with different  cells including human cells and you have to compare the metabolism and

115
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:45.480
Haddouk: And select the two spaces which are representative for for the metabolism of compound in human

116
00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:54.390
Haddouk: Then you have the toxic or kinetic and pharmacogenetics studies that are part of the general toxicology studies.

117
00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:05.400
Haddouk: Not the pharmacogenetics one but two toxic or kinetic one. And for this you have to ensure that your major metabolites. That's our

118
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:13.470
Haddouk: That's our ultimate goal is, as I said before, are covered and that you don't have any major metabolize which is under

119
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:29.970
Haddouk: Represented in the non clinical species or not represented at all. In that case, you might even have to sensitize and to do for the development program for your major metabolites and if none of the non clinical species can

120
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:53.760
Haddouk: Generated within the toxicology studies, of course, you have to run the reprotox studies and for this as well. You need to specify one rodents, which is usually the the rat or mice and one non rodents, which is usually the rabbit and

121
00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:55.710
Haddouk: And

122
00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:14.220
Haddouk: Then as yes as well. You have to do the general toxicity and you do for this, the full package which cover in vitro usually two different tests in vitro for annotation and the chromosome abberation and then additional tests in vivo that you can do later.

123
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:25.560
Haddouk: In the program development in case you're, of course, to individual tests when they get there is any positive, you have to investigate this quickly and

124
00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:36.540
Haddouk: And run one in vivo, or potentially to enable studies before you. You can you are able to go in first in man.

125
00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:45.990
Haddouk: For the carcinogenic potential it with depends on the duration of use of the compound and also the

126
00:24:46.650 --> 00:25:01.200
Haddouk: Nature of the compound typically for oncology compounds will be not to carcinogenic studies quite raw, but for many indication, you will have to run these studies in two spaces as well, and

127
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:08.700
Haddouk: You might do auto clinical studies which are dependent on a case by case basis.

128
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:25.710
Haddouk: This can be photo toxicity studies, studies, depending on which one we were dependent on the absorption coefficient of your compound, not only for topical compounds, but also sometimes for orally administered compounds, because

129
00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:41.250
Haddouk: For the toxicity can happen. Also for orally administers compounds and also of course the assessment of immuno-toxicity and use the bioavailability  studies for some CNS compounds to be

130
00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:44.880
Haddouk: For a biologic

131
00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:58.590
Haddouk: So we start from the for the same list, but there are some distinction to have here, so usually for the pharmacology studies you don't run standalone studies you run them as part of

132
00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:05.310
Haddouk: The toxicology studies. It's a low. The tolerated by you by specific guidelines for Biologics

133
00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:15.810
Haddouk: Because you are supposed to have less concerns in time, typically have codec such as we said before, because there is no expected interaction with the the

134
00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:28.470
Haddouk: The hERG channel for the cardiac safety, although channels and therefore there is more high level assessment, which can be part of the general toxicology studies on

135
00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:34.890
Haddouk: You run, of course, your general toxicology study and usually

136
00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:43.290
Haddouk: It's, it's, it is represented with one species, but that species has to be relevant and

137
00:26:44.190 --> 00:27:04.950
Haddouk: And for antibodies, especially fully human antibodies usually depends also on the target the non human primates is the relevance of spaces, but if it happens that you have two different elements pieces, then you will have to to run the box study in both spaces so

138
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:12.990
Haddouk: One important thing is to understand what is our 11th spaces and here you have a definition from the guidelines.

139
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:27.840
Haddouk: Are 11 spaces is a pharmacology active due to the expression of the research over the top and for the case of monoclonal antibodies and which show similarities to cross reactivity profile to human

140
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:38.820
Haddouk: So usually it's non human primates, but it can be another species as well. And in that case, it has to be evaluated on the top of the non human primates for the biology.

141
00:27:41.880 --> 00:28:00.810
Haddouk: You also have to assess to do toxic or kinetic and pharmacogenetics studies. And for this one particularity in comparison to the small molecules is that he will have also to assess for the immunogenicity the capacity of a compound to and use antibody against the drug.

142
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:07.500
Haddouk: And which might result I said before in higher clearance of your own body or

143
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:16.500
Haddouk: Automatically to toxicology effects as well, which are secondary to the ADA and action.

144
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.230
Haddouk: You also have to run our product studies and

145
00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:36.390
Haddouk: Which is more challenging for Biologics because running or Pathak studies in in non human primate is not an easy easy things to do and

146
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:51.750
Haddouk: Also, in that case, and if it's well justified, you can have what we call the anomalous material or surrogate antibody that will represent the modification of your compound, but it's not the drug.

147
00:28:52.290 --> 00:29:02.400
Haddouk: Itself. And in that case, you have to assess if it is relevant to us to to have a surrogate antibody that will be tested typically

148
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:13.530
Haddouk: If you let's say you you work on a target, you have to to sensitize the equivalent antibody for that target in the rather than species and

149
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:24.180
Haddouk: Then you will test the surrogates antibody from the rat, for example, from the minds that you will administer to the rats for this that studies or the opposite.

150
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:43.530
Haddouk: And to avoid having the antibody the fully human antibody test and in the minds because if there is no cross reactivity is between services, it will not be a real evidence. So you have better to assess the mechanism of action using the surrogate antibody in the audience business right

151
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:55.110
Haddouk: For general toxicity. This is something go you don't turn for the biologics, except if you have the only case where you have to do it is when you have

152
00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:09.420
Haddouk: Antibody drag congregates and in case the conjugate the small molecules is conjugated to the doctor linker and then you have to assess the effects on the organic linker. In that case, but the antibody itself.

153
00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:18.870
Haddouk: Doesn't have to be assessed in general toxicity studies because it's not expected to to have any general toxic effect.

154
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:37.110
Haddouk: For the carcinogenic potential and as well. It's on a case by case. And if you do modification of the compound and that's what it's very important to have a good understanding of this preclude from having any carcinogenic potential, then maybe you can argue and have a

155
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:43.380
Haddouk: waiver for for that day and it kind of studies, typically, and

156
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:50.040
Haddouk: For the other non clinical studies examples that can be listed for for the

157
00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:58.980
Haddouk: Antibodies is typically the cost is a cross reactivity and the immuno toxicity assessment that you have to do for such component

158
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:06.870
Haddouk: This is just to give you a picture of

159
00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:25.890
Haddouk: Typical strategy and timing of the non clinical development program that you have to run for an example of and you can be no more directory monoclonal antibody and it gives you the list for the timing.

160
00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:39.150
Haddouk: What you have the minimum, you have to do before your, your phase one study, and what can be done later when you're when you're face to entries that is

161
00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:41.340
Haddouk: Just an example.

162
00:31:47.790 --> 00:32:00.990
Haddouk: So here we will focus on the to give an example for for the generic toxicology studies which are considered Bible studies because you will derive your no idea from the studies as well. So we can

163
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.140
Haddouk: Expand more on this.

164
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:12.840
Haddouk: So for your services selection, as I said before, for the small molecules, it will

165
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:23.940
Haddouk: Mainly depend on the metabolism and the exposure data, you will have and also you can have to consider the target expression in the

166
00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:40.050
Haddouk: Market mechanical spaces and i said before you and that usually to have the robin spaces as one of them specificity to this could be my son rights, depending on the metabolism of five.

167
00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:53.580
Haddouk: And one nonresidents usually it's the dark can be the Winnipeg and unless it is justified, it's rarely the monkey, but if

168
00:32:53.940 --> 00:33:08.130
Haddouk: No, no dog on any big doesn't cover this the metabolism for find the from your data in vitro, you might sometimes need to go with the monkey for such purposes, but it's not the first choice for the fall ethically speaking

169
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:18.000
Haddouk: For the monoclonal antibody, you usually normally to include story 11 spaces, however.

170
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:28.710
Haddouk: If Apple created just to find one relevance pieces can suffer if you prove that your auntie by the cross react on the with the

171
00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:46.710
Haddouk: In the tissue cross reactivity studying betrayal you prove that it's contracts only with the with the one one spicier than you would need if it is only the monkey, then you can justify for using only the monkey for your tax assessment.

172
00:33:49.860 --> 00:34:01.440
Haddouk: And sometimes it can happen for some new targets or very specific targets that you don't have a relevant specifically which you could identify from your initial evaluation in vitro.

173
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:17.700
Haddouk: And in that case, you need to use a transgenic animal that were the human target is expressed and or possibly or instead of evaluating your drug evaluate the surrogates using the

174
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.160
Haddouk: Other spaces.

175
00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:33.960
Haddouk: Appropriate for the surrogates, which is you can do it as we said for the robotics. It might be more challenges to justify it from for the toxic studies and then

176
00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:55.920
Haddouk: Sometimes on you can face the issue of not having any real 11 spaces. Nader and a transgenic model one possibility to have a surrogate antibody and you can potentially use only the individual data, but you have really to have

177
00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:01.290
Haddouk: A stronger understanding of your pharmacology.

178
00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:18.030
Haddouk: And have your justification, which sometimes has to go through initial in vivo studies proving that is another element spaces in any case before you can use only individual data, potentially, to, to, to justify

179
00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:38.070
Haddouk: The transition from in vitro data to to to human, but the rationale for this has to be a witness trombley justify them documented and and with the additional experiments and at demonstrating the non relevance of the non clinical spaces there.

180
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:51.120
Haddouk: For the duration of the general toxicology study. This is extracted from the entry ice educate line and typically before you start

181
00:35:53.100 --> 00:36:08.340
Haddouk: This is in support of the clinical trial before you start any study in human let's say if you know you maximum expected duration of the clinical trial in the human is up to two weeks then

182
00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:19.800
Haddouk: The duration for the studies in non clinical should be equivalent in general, the minimum the duration of the clinical trial. So, if it is between two and six.

183
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:27.090
Haddouk: Months, what is expected in the clinical trial, you need to have same as the clinical trial at least

184
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:42.990
Haddouk: Two, four, or six, depending on the duration expected in the clinical trials for the non clinical studies and if it is beyond six months. So you have to run toxicology studies up to six months for the relevance and nine months for the novel.

185
00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:46.500
Haddouk: This is for clinical trial.

186
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:50.400
Haddouk: Insertion

187
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:51.960
Haddouk: And

188
00:36:54.330 --> 00:37:02.250
Haddouk: This Bible study should know for for the for the determination of the new y&r non adverse effects.

189
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:17.280
Haddouk: And should be gap compliant. So according to good laboratory practice and before, in order to ensure that you will get your no idea within our study, usually it's recommended, of course, to have

190
00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:31.920
Haddouk: A preliminary study which is for the maximum to writer to define the maximum tolerated dose, which is for those who aren't finding study in order to ensure that your main Bible study is done under the appropriate conditions.

191
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.550
Haddouk: Before marketing the compound.

192
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:56.880
Haddouk: Here again you have a summary of indicated treatment duration for the marketed compound and the minimum recommended duration for the repeater does toxicity studies that you need to run in residence and non work and studies. This is also extracted from the entry guideline.

193
00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.030
Haddouk: For non clinical activities.

194
00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:05.790
Haddouk: So for the design.

195
00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:13.440
Haddouk: Their minimum required information that you need to consider before initiating toxicology study

196
00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:24.270
Haddouk: You have to consider, of course, the tablets. You can location, the anticipated regime and toes, the administration was the the duration of treatment.

197
00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:33.210
Haddouk: Have some knowledge about target affinity spaces cross reactivity, the farmer kinetic for fine.

198
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:43.860
Haddouk: If you have already some grip on some PG biomarkers and pharmacogenomics to have also to have an idea what you could follow in the animal studies and

199
00:38:44.820 --> 00:39:05.940
Haddouk: Of course, have all the methods in place for your TK and and immunogenicity a means to how to detect, for example, for biological your own your own compound, but also the antibiotic again the antibodies, the ag AG antibodies. We can do against your monoclonal antibody.

200
00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:22.230
Haddouk: So from the design file to you, so it covers the minimum to be covered with dinner talk study. It's the clinical observation, of course, of the animals, the body weight and the food consumption for no one during the study

201
00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:31.110
Haddouk: The safety pharmacology parameters, even for the small Monique is if you have this applies for both small it is, and the large molecules.

202
00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:36.630
Haddouk: But even if you have standalone studies for small molecules for salsify Mukherjee still need

203
00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:45.090
Haddouk: To assess some parameters during the toxicology study because the safety pharmacology studies as you are usually done for

204
00:39:45.780 --> 00:40:01.050
Haddouk: acute treatment single those however for toxicology studies you administer repeated those. And it's important to assess the ECG, and the blood pressure effect also after repeated those in with the compound.

205
00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:06.120
Haddouk: Of course, you have to assess for of time most of the

206
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:15.540
Haddouk: pre order to start with the treatment and after completion of treatment and if there is any reverse phase within the study also after the completion of the reverse phase.

207
00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:25.080
Haddouk: The rest phase means you have stopped treatment of the compound and you allow animals to recover for and from any findings, if there was any finding their

208
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:37.440
Haddouk: During an additional direction to see if you have any effect at the end of the treatment if that effect is reversible. Not so such assessments has to be done at the end of the treatments barrier.

209
00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:43.860
Haddouk: Before the treatment better at the end of the treatment therapy and at the end of the recovery. The treatment for

210
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:52.560
Haddouk: clinical pathology. So it's typical biochemistry mythology and calculation factors to be assessed.

211
00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:58.320
Haddouk: The immuno phenotype in the immuno

212
00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:21.570
Haddouk: mineralogy aspects sultry middle of funnel type in a nonlinear analysis as well. If possible, and then the toxic or kinetic as we said exposure and immunogenicity the idea and then fact when exposure to the component for the case of the biologics, and the microscopic examiner wants the

213
00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:34.530
Haddouk: Studies terminated and the animals are sacrifice to have to do the microscopic examination, and most importantly, to do the microscopic examination, which also record. Usually the history pathology.

214
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:47.700
Haddouk: Because this is the key element to see how you're finding in bio chemistry and the mythology are reflected in the findings in the organ and microscopic tissue.

215
00:41:48.720 --> 00:42:03.690
Haddouk: Examination because at the completion of this study all the organs tissues from the whole body are examine examine under the microscope to see that and finding and compared to the fake a control group, which is not treatment.

216
00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:15.030
Haddouk: Of course, and the other 11th parameter biomarker, which is driven by the knowledge of the pharmacology of the compound has to be if possible assessed.

217
00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:22.170
Haddouk: And all these parameters will be considered in the in the determination of the known have served

218
00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:33.750
Haddouk: Adverse Effect level than one. Yeah, and also sometimes for oncology, we don't necessarily have the No idea.

219
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:47.970
Haddouk: Because of the high dosage of the compounds as well. But we determine who they tell me what we call the highly non severity toxic dose, which can also be used for the determination of the first set in men and those

220
00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:56.670
Haddouk: Then when you want to transition from non clinical too early clinical

221
00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:01.860
Haddouk: Studies. There are some as we said some

222
00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:21.180
Haddouk: items to be taken into account. So you have to estimate the first the first doesn't human for this you will use in general don't know why. Yeah. As we said before, the highly not say very toxic those oncology compound that you obtained from your mechanical

223
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:33.840
Haddouk: toxicology by portal gap study. And if you have two different species who have been tested for your toxicology assessment, you have to consider.

224
00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:45.300
Haddouk: The most sensitive or 11 species for for that assessment. Let's say you have two different no idea if both species are relevant, you will take the lowest those

225
00:43:45.720 --> 00:44:04.470
Haddouk: Are the most sensitive spaces and therefore the lowest know again for the calculation of the human equivalent tools and from that those you will derive what we call a safety factor. And then in order to determine the minimum required starting those in in in human form phase one.

226
00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:14.400
Haddouk: Sorry, the maximum recommended starting those then for this.

227
00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:28.290
Haddouk: Starting those you might need to apply additional or decrease increase or decrease the safety factor because for the for the safety factor should be minimum of 10 and you might

228
00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:53.610
Haddouk: Increase that factor or decreases depending on on how severe was defined in in the toxicology studies in non clinical spaces in let's say if you have an absence of any monetary signs during the toxicology studies, it's might be a higher risk because you might not have any

229
00:44:55.140 --> 00:45:09.210
Haddouk: Alerting signals during the clinical studies. So you might need to increase the safety factor because you want to avoid having this toxicity that you have seen in the in the non clinical spaces. If you are in

230
00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:12.990
Haddouk: Not in a good position to have to have

231
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:23.250
Haddouk: An alerting meters on this toxic effects of course if you are

232
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:41.880
Haddouk: Working with another teacher perfect target you might go in a gray zone which you don't have a good understanding and knowledge. In that case, you might have also to increase the safety margin in order to to test significantly lower those compared to what you have seen in

233
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.840
Haddouk: What you have tested in any case basis.

234
00:45:49.200 --> 00:46:04.710
Haddouk: On the other hand, if you have very well characterized the compound the class of compounds, the effect that you see is predictable is reversible. It's easily monitored. You might even sometimes have to

235
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:18.360
Haddouk: Have the possibility to to slightly decreased do your safety factor of 10 to it might might start with the safety factor of 10 or five a tree or five. Sorry, instead of them, but this of course has to be

236
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.510
Haddouk: Proposed and agreed.

237
00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:31.680
Haddouk: Upon with the regulatory authorities, which will give you the the approval for the start of your clinical testing.

238
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:41.760
Haddouk: You can also, and more importantly, have to consider lowering the dose of LSD.

239
00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:52.440
Haddouk: When appropriate if you have more information specifically for the biological compound regarding the pharmacology play active those

240
00:46:53.610 --> 00:47:01.740
Haddouk: And we will see in the case study, we will discuss later in the second part of this presentation and example for this.

241
00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:07.800
Haddouk: Okay, so here I finished with my first part and

242
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:10.230
Haddouk: We can have

243
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:16.980
Haddouk: To break here. And before we we go to the translation and aspect and the case studies.

244
00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:21.510
Gautam Maitra: Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you know we stopped.
