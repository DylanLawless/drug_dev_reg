1
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:16.800
Haddouk: Hello. So let's now talk about some transnational aspects and consideration which has to be have to be taken here and what I call a risk factors that has to be have to be considered.

2
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:34.560
Haddouk: Because these factors might increase the concern we have in transitioning from the preclinical to the clinical studies. And for this, there is a very good

3
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.170
Haddouk: Published work by Governor on 2008 you can refer to it. For more details, but I give you a summary and

4
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.020
Haddouk: There is a distinction to have between what we would call

5
00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:02.340
Haddouk: And high risk therapeutic so we can first understand, have a good understanding what is the difference. And this can be done based on different aspects that start with the mode of action.

6
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:16.380
Haddouk: So typically, if you have another, of course, diabetic, it's, it will be of higher risk. Definitely. Then if you work with a follow up agent or known democratic targets.

7
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.620
Haddouk: Of course, high risk traffic six are diabetics with a poorly understanding of the mechanism.

8
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:37.830
Haddouk: If your target has limited physiological interactions, then it's between more be classified as the standard as a standard therapeutics

9
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:50.610
Haddouk: Compared to the higher risk diabetics, with a little tropic and the systemic activity bypass which can over run physiological control which might generate more risks.

10
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.130
Haddouk: Of course, any compound which has a potential for amplification or surprisingly our

11
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:10.200
Haddouk: Response. We will because you have higher risk compared to a more target in area sampling and dose response, which is more

12
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.490
Haddouk: Standing in the stone data therapeutics area and say,

13
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:24.750
Haddouk: And last one and we're pleased as we said before, it's very good to have biomarkers and easily monitored.

14
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:44.640
Haddouk: Pharmacology and Toxicology with the defined and validated by markers. If you are lacking this biomarkers for to follow the effects in terms of pharmacology of toxicology, so it makes the case more difficult and classify better protect more in the high risk area.

15
00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:01.230
Haddouk: Last but not least, neither if you have any finding that you have seen in the toxicology studies and if that finding was reversible. Of course, it's more easily manageable and the light

16
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:14.010
Haddouk: Compared to the fact if if it was irreversible. If there is a minimum possible irreversible toxicity, then that therapeutic is of high risk compared to the reversible effects.

17
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.430
Haddouk: If we consider the nature of the target.

18
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.440
Haddouk: If you have

19
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.030
Haddouk: Compounds with good specificity than

20
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.600
Haddouk: The target or the disease. If it's easy. The more much more easy manageable.

21
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:47.190
Haddouk: If the target is non critical and has redundancy. So the risk is lower than if it's a poorly understood mechanism regarding the targets.

22
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:55.110
Haddouk: And of course target reads, which has limited physiological interaction is have less risk and then

23
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:07.920
Haddouk: For the the animal models and there are elements of they have also to be considered for this assessment.

24
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:17.970
Haddouk: Is your compound has to be classified as high risk or standard risk. Of course, if you have a good stricter homology for your

25
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.450
Haddouk: target distribution and senior in pathway between your animal model and what to expect for from

26
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:40.680
Haddouk: Human then you are more in a standard area. If you have a very poor understanding or very poor structure or morphology between the target distribution and signalling pathways between on non clinical and your clinical study

27
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:49.140
Haddouk: spacies which is the human and therefore the risk might be considered definitely higher

28
00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:09.420
Haddouk: One thing is the interaction and the and the district target expression. And one thing is the pharmacological effect if it is comparable between the mice, let's say, and and the model in etc and what you expect from what you see you for much, you know, under human

29
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.110
Haddouk: Pharmacological expected affecting human the best

30
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.950
Haddouk: This is comparable, the better. This is incompatible and the lower risk you have for assessment.

31
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.340
Haddouk: And

32
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:39.390
Haddouk: Are the model that you use well established already and are they proven for the predictive or they're considered predictive

33
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:50.220
Haddouk: If it is the case, and then you are more in a song that area. If it is not the case and very rare disease and or if your disease after

34
00:05:50.700 --> 00:06:00.240
Haddouk: The relevance of the animal, other than maybe your productivity of the model to predict activity or from other is not so good. And then you are more in high risk area.

35
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:10.380
Haddouk: For the consideration of the the first does in human, of course.

36
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:24.510
Haddouk: When you have you are, you have to deal with higher risk therapeutics. It is definitely more commander to use the maybe the minimum anticipated biological effect level approach because you will

37
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:32.910
Haddouk: Base your estimation. Based on this, and based on the knowledge you have after compound, rather than

38
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:43.680
Haddouk: For the standard therapeutics, usually the no idea is what you use when it's a new target or that particular area.

39
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:58.560
Haddouk: You, you have some understanding about the pharmacological active each of our compound, how it behaves in animals and in human and better, we will see the case example we will have later, the better understanding of this and will

40
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:11.220
Haddouk: Reduce it's rather recommended to use the the the MABEL for your decision making, rather than NOAEL or whatever the lowest those for this data.

41
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.520
Haddouk: And of course, if you are with high risk appetite compound.

42
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:33.390
Haddouk: Using their human healthy volunteers might not be possible, and it says most likely more likely that you will go for the patient population because we don't want to, to the benefit risk is more

43
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:54.330
Haddouk: Manageable ratio with the benefits risk ratio is more manageable for with the patients, then we're healthy volunteers or there is not real benefit, but all the risks of the higher risk. The risk is the lowest view will have the possibility to go in healthy volunteers for that's compounds.

44
00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:11.460
Haddouk: Of course, you have to use all in vitro and in vivo data include a receptor binding and almost more importantly the occupancy the concentration response relationship, the pK they in the relevant species for these considerations.

45
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:27.420
Haddouk: And applied appropriate safety factor and with specifically with the high risk therapeutics in NOAEL area. You might have seen to decrease to lower to starting dose after having applied the safety factor.

46
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.940
Haddouk: To take a more caution in escalating the

47
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:36.840
Haddouk: Doses during the human study

48
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:47.520
Haddouk: And also to to increase your safety monitoring, because you might not be in a position to better

49
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:58.140
Haddouk: Have a grip on what finding you might have because you are in gray zone don't have full understanding of what will happen there.

50
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:00.480
Haddouk: Okay.

51
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.940
Haddouk: For the case study here I have taken an example you

52
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:15.120
Haddouk: I'm sure you have already heard about it and for an first negative results for the non clinical species was

53
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.750
Haddouk: Afterwards after this

54
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.000
Haddouk: tragedy happens in fact was considered as non relevant

55
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:38.310
Haddouk: This is the case for what we call the Tegenero compound that company does not exist anymore. It's a German company. I think if I remember well and this was for the TGN 1412

56
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:49.350
Haddouk: This compound is the IgG4 or with the stimulatory mode of action on the set on the specific subset of cells, which are the regulatory T cells.

57
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.450
Haddouk: And

58
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:59.070
Haddouk: This molecule binds to the CD 28

59
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:16.800
Haddouk: Receptor and and and activates T cells without the need of the cell receptor and and it leads to Polycom T cell expansion and activation and increase of iron to production, that's typically what we call a super agonists.

60
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.110
Haddouk: And

61
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.000
Haddouk: Antagonists

62
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:35.280
Haddouk: This the compound was developed because it will start getting a B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in which the T cells are deficient and the aim was  to expand that cell population.

63
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:43.740
Haddouk: And also for some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis in which the T regulatory cells expansion might be beneficial.

64
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:58.170
Haddouk: So what happened in the 13th of March 2006 and there was a Phase one trial going in UK with six healthy volunteers.

65
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:09.210
Haddouk: Which who are treated with this compound and they end up having a near fatal systemic inflammatory immune response to what we typically call a cytokine storm

66
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:26.700
Haddouk: The clinical trial was composed of eight healthy volunteers made volunteers. The trial was randomized, double blind it and you have a placebo control group. So again, you had six and

67
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:39.240
Haddouk: Compound. TGN1412 treated healthy volunteers and two who are under placebo and the those escalation study. The first those was

68
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:52.050
Haddouk: Was quite low. It was 0.1 milligram per kg and the serious adverse reaction were observed on on the on the six

69
00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:55.680
Haddouk: Compound treated the healthy volunteers.

70
00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:07.080
Haddouk: So the questions to ask. In that case was this predictable and the possibly avoidable from the non clinical studies.

71
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:20.040
Haddouk: So there was a subsequent analysis of the data and this resulted in a very huge amount of investigation and work which which is called the DAF report.

72
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:31.380
Haddouk: They initial screening assessments, they find out that the starting those was based on the new idea of extrapolated from the

73
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:43.470
Haddouk: Repeaters cinema. Yes, monkey, which was tested the new idea was 50 milligrams per kilogram. And when you consider the scaling factor and the human equivalent dose

74
00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:59.250
Haddouk: The safety margin, which was applied compared to the know again in monkey was more than 160 which was definitely six, which was six teen fold higher than the minimum recommended safety.

75
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:05.460
Haddouk: Margin of ten say it was well done that point.

76
00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.210
Haddouk: Then you have

77
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:27.600
Haddouk: Some consideration for the affinity of the compound to the human and macac CD 28 and they had equal affinity in terms of binding.

78
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:39.630
Haddouk: They were many investigation run on the formulation which was used for the clinical trial because they wanted to exclude any

79
00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:47.970
Haddouk: Consideration any but this is about the bad manufacturing of the compound contamination.

80
00:13:48.780 --> 00:14:03.870
Haddouk: The compound was compliance with the product specific specification. The compound was free of any pro inflammatory contaminants, which could have resulted in this increase of inflammatory reaction. This cytokine control and

81
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:15.630
Haddouk: There was no specific concern about the formulation and based on the NOAEL and the safety margin. There was nothing which was alerting at that step. Therefore, the

82
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.840
Haddouk: MHRA which is the

83
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:32.850
Haddouk: Regulatory Agency in UK requested for an expert special group or to work on this Phase one trial and to investigate and more deeply the biological properties TGN1412 under the

84
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:57.330
Haddouk: Assessment took a few months when it's eight years and we will see later. And in fact, they realized for this that there was no information which was really projected for the plasma concentration in human the CD 28 receptor occupancy necessary for the desired pharmacological effect.

85
00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:08.910
Haddouk: To have the T rex stimulation was missing. So there was no data on the expected receptor occupancy to have the desired pharmacological effect, though.

86
00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:19.500
Haddouk: There is a lack of data there, and also for the pharmacological products are the effects in the first human in human are competent human volunteers.

87
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:37.830
Haddouk: To compare what it would be expected in human volunteers compared to patient. The patient population. There was no information on this and therefore the first conclusion was that the first inhuman was not placed in any pharmacological context for the human population.

88
00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:59.310
Haddouk: Following this, you can see here that many since that data before report, which was in December 2006 they were many work investigation research publication until 2013

89
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:06.900
Haddouk: Around this issue to try to understand why the mode of the non clinical study was not

90
00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:15.810
Haddouk: predictive of what would happen in human knowing that the NOAEL was safety margin based on the way here was very high.

91
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:30.030
Haddouk: And knowing that with consideration also to the fact that the CD 28 has comparable affinity in the monkey and the human and so there was a need to to better understand where the issue stance.

92
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:42.360
Haddouk: And this took many years before so they they realized in fact that we are working on many individual adaptation for the model of cytokine.

93
00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:58.140
Haddouk: And that cytokine induction in vitro they realized that for TGN1412 a pro inflammatory cytokine response in vitro was only generated when the PBMC

94
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:09.720
Haddouk: were present in a certain way within the invitro, what we call in, they will be mobilized under plastics surface to have a better exposure to them.

95
00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:22.380
Haddouk: And in based on that assessment, they, they, after they have recalculated for the those which the concentration. All those which would have really

96
00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:33.960
Haddouk: Connected to a pro inflammatory cytokines release they realized that in fact that the volunteers have been exposed to a nearly a maximum immuno stimulatory those

97
00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:48.870
Haddouk: And the for the PBMC in from cynomolgus Monkey. They were not stimulated with the individual, even when they are immobilized on the on the surface plates.

98
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.470
Haddouk: In the place of the surface of the plates.

99
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.950
Haddouk: And that's was

100
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:04.710
Haddouk: I would say consistent with the fact that there was a feeler failure in having the effect detected in vitro.

101
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:13.440
Haddouk: And also in the in vivo monkey study, they haven't seen any effects or there was consistency between individual data in the monkey.

102
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:21.420
Haddouk: Compared to the invivo data . They tend the monkey whatever you use the previous assessment, which has been done, or the new

103
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:41.100
Haddouk: immobilization mode for the cytikine response in vitro and there was consistency there. However, for the human in vitro data now with this modification showed that there was a new middle stimulatory effect, which was observed in the human cells, but not in the monkey cells.

104
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:52.170
Haddouk: So they tried to go deeper in this underside understand why there is this difference in vitro between human and the monkey cells

105
00:18:53.700 --> 00:19:13.140
Haddouk: So they realize that in fact the cytokine response stimulated by this TGN 1412 was not mediated by the same mechanism has auto therapeutic agents which are normally and easily detected with the standard way of assessing in vitro and TGN in fact,

106
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:20.910
Haddouk: Using the adapted method would reveal more activity. And in fact, it was demonstrated that

107
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:35.400
Haddouk: TG and 1412 stimulation of CD4 for a factory effectual memory T cells in the peripheral tissue tissue is the model faction of how regenerate the cytokine storm, which was different from the other

108
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.040
Haddouk: Therapeutic agents.

109
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:50.940
Haddouk: And then the question is why this was not observed in vitro and in vivo in the cynomolgus monkey because they could after was demonstrated in the in vitro for the human cells, but not for the monkeys.

110
00:19:51.510 --> 00:20:08.220
Haddouk: In fact, simply because this affects our memory cells in the c monkeys. The CD4  factor memory says do not express the CD28 which which was not known before and access to before.

111
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:17.640
Haddouk: And therefore, since they're not they're not expressing the CD 28 they cannot be stimulated by by the TGN 1412

112
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:36.810
Haddouk: And therefore the trial failure due to the specific differences in CD 28 expressions CD4  memory cells come simply from the fact that the c monkey in that case is not pharmacologically relevant species for from this compound.

113
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:48.000
Haddouk: So since then, the depth report recommended that the calculation of the starting, those should be used.

114
00:20:49.140 --> 00:21:06.540
Haddouk: On user relevant information. And in that case, the relevant information is not the NOAEL in the monkey, but rather the minimum anticipated biological effect level for the human finally from the individual adapted test for the cytokine release.

115
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:23.220
Haddouk: And the maybe the minimum anticipated biological effect level is assumption is that the modification when it is well known pre on to the first in human, it has to be considered in first and stands for specifically for the biologics

116
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:37.560
Haddouk: And the EMA Guideline was adapted later on after that trial and 2017 to to focus on the better understanding which is needed for the

117
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:49.860
Haddouk: pharmacology effects of the compound specially when you are in a novel traffic area and the use of the Mabel for for the for the extrapolation to to the human

118
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.490
