## Why many fail ? Case studies

Good funding, private and VC, etc.
Q. Prepare to fail.

Why is the majority of cash not on the front runner?
Q. However, investors always say - you have one product but what next? And pitches for single product, investors say no, I want share of whole company...

Case 2 was unnamed but I believe is about TGN1412 famous Ab trial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa063842).
Perhaps it was a more recent, less drematic incident, but the sentiment is the same. 

Case 3 
convert from chemistry service to cancer Ab company, bought by bigger company. Ends up being a failure because no progress. The story was a sales pitch instead of eviednce-based.

Case 4
Phase III, very experienced colleagues (Biotech and CRO people).
But the trail is so big that the staff are not experienced in phase III.

## Typical startup pitch
PhD project was to make a start-up.

He didn't realise:
* The strategic founder brings:
* GLP tox can take 18-24 months
* Big invest for requirements
* Pleclinical and CMC to be IND ready
* Requires experience

### Interesting mentions
* Business agents club Basel. 
* Good, fast, or cheap, pick 2.
* Prioritise
* Righ to trial idea, risk, in US politics
* How to comunicate a product - founders, etc have no idea. 


## Other course notes from today

## Qs:
* The notes on moodle are excellent. You cite the index of a plan. I think you do not link the original on proposal to confirm, for the first hyperlinks, they link to old moodle forum posts, so they no longer work (for us). Do you have a link to the original?

* When you say that each individual will take at least 2 points, you mean for example:
	- ICH Guidelines - S2 Genotoxicity Studies
	- ICH Guidelines - S4 Toxicity Testing
Understand and summarise, list the requirements that we must comply.
* Translate the general terms to our specific product or keep the wording as found in the original guideline?

## Project proposals
*  Aaron Petruzzella (Drug) inhib of protease cathepsin s, and b. Ab delivery system for tissue specificty, invivo for the fist and want to do invivo for second. 
*  Alexandre Coudray (possibly Diagnostic) microfluidic drug screen devices using single cell in droplet with RNA express and ML to predict cell. 
*  Shiyu Cheng (Drug - Advanced Therapy) aftificial blood vessel.
*  Kunal Sharma (Medical Device - organ-on-a-chip) want to focus on regulatory, quite far already.
