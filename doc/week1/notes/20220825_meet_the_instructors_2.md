## Drug Development Process, Preclinical, clinical, CMC. EU Regulatory Process. 
Presented by: Gautam Maitra, EPFL SV, Catalyze4Life.

## Overview of Preclinical Requirements - small Molecules and Biotech Products. 
Presented by: Hasnaà Haddouk, Head of Biological Sciences & Non Clinical Safety Immunology at Sobi - Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, Geneva, Switzerland.

* "Preclinical" is not the same as "non clinical". Non clinical continues until it is on market, etc.
* Main activites are before Ph I.
* What 
	- pharmacol
	- general tox (usually 1 relevant * species, NHP, max 6 month)
	- Toxicokinetic and nonclinical PK studies (ADA assessment, immunogenicity)
	- DART
	- Genotox (for biologic or small molecule)
	- Carcinogenic 
	- other nonclinical studies case-by-case, esp for SME. and before an in vivo studies.

Releveant species must have the same target, for example, expression of epitope/receptor. May be waived if you have grounds for no real effect.

* Key considerations: SME versus biological comparison list

* For first in human, examine what data you have and follow guidelines
	- FDA 2005 estimate max safe starting dose in adult healthy volunteers
	- EMA R1 2017, identify and mitidate risk
	- ICH M3 R2, 2009
	- ICH S9 2010

* Many endpoints to consider
	-	NOAEAL: tox endpoints
	-	STD10: Oncology endpoints
	-	HNSTD: Oncology endpoints
	-	MABEL: PD endpoints
	-	PAD: PD endpoints
	-	ATD: PD endpoints

* EMA revised guideline 2017
	- combined SAD/MAD, food eddect/drug-drug interaction
	- emerging human PJ and PD data from previous cohort
	- progression from SAD to MAD based on PK-PD modelling
	- sentinel dosing
	- both SAD and MAD unless justified
	-
* MAD studies
	- characterise PK and metabolites (NME) at steady state, 
	- accumulation potential 
	- dose proportionality
	- MTD

* Clarify GXP vs GLP
* Non-GXP - not under GLP standard: double check this.
* Sometimes non GLP labs would be academic, and these may require inspection to ensure that the data is real and reliable. 


### Sobi examples:
* Kineret (anakinra) is a recombinant protein drug approved for the treatment of patients with CAPS (cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome), RA (rheumatoid arthritis), FMF (familial Mediterranean fever), DIRA (deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) and Still's disease including systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) and adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD). Kineret blocks the biological activity of IL-1 by binding to the interleukin-1 type 1 receptor, expressed in a wide variety of tissues and organs. Anakinra differs from the sequence of Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist by one methionine amino acid added to its N-terminus; it also differs from the human protein in that it is not glycosylated, as it is manufactured in Escherichia coli.

* MEDI8897 (nirsevimab): Prefusion F-targeting Monoclonal Antibody for RSV infection. Sobi has the right to AstraZeneca's full share of US losses and profits for nirsevimab.

* loncastuximab tesirine: It is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized antibody targeting the protein CD19. It is stochastically conjugated via a valine-alanine cleavable, maleimide linker to a cytotoxic (anticancer) pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive, malignant, orphan disease in haematology with an incidence in Europe of approximately 4 cases per 100,000 adults per year. As many as 40 per cent of all patients with DLBCL will need at least a 2nd-line treatment as their disease is relapsing or refractory. For those patients, effective treatment options are limited, representing a critical unmet need. 

Q. Are there any special regulations the apply to orphan drugs and rare disease where the number of cases is exteremly low and sometimes last resort. Keywords to search?

Q. SOBI is a good example of where drugs are used off-label. Could you say something about this; is there every any intention that a products' main application will be off-label?

Q. Rational can be stretched - is there pressure to be conservative/safe versus progress?

Q. When you are beginning a new project, are the circumstances unique each time, or do you have a prepared table of contents which you sequentially populate with completed regulatory steps?

Q. Do you have any particlar non-clinical safety steps that are most critical, or is it a complete gambit?

Q. part 1. Does the company actively push for open documentation - probably not since it's so much unneccessary work?
Q. part 2. Are there any examples of a product from SOBI that list or reference all of the fruitful steps that lead to market?

## Clinical Trials in the EU and UK (post-Brexit).
Presented by: Anne Hamel, Senior Manager Regulatory Affairs at AC Immune SA.
"From the lab bench to the bedside - a fantastic voyage of drug development."

* Clinical dev and Ph I-III.

* Before clinical trial (CT) review slides
* EU framework
	- EU CTR 536/2014
	- EI CTD 2001/20/EC 
	- Guidelines ICH, EMA

* CTD triangle
* <https://www.ich.org/page/ctd>
* MA dossier based on agreed eCTD format (ICH M4).
* [CTD_triangle_color_Proofread.pdf]

* Centralized procedure versus nationalized procedure.
* 3 type of market authorisation: Standard MA - comprehensive data package, COnditional - not as comprehensive but with additional caveats, MA under exceptional circumstance - e.g. very small population so no additional data is available. 
*
* UK clinical trial: coasssess MHRA and REC docs for a single decision.


Q. To navigate multiple regional regulations, do you tackle each region individually, in parallel or do you create some sort of master-document that you complete once and then adapt to each region?

Q. Is it correct that you do not publish an ordered list of each completed regulatory step?
No.
But in CTR law some must be public. CTD IB and protocol of approved ones. CMC, manufact, etc is not public, or sponsor.
