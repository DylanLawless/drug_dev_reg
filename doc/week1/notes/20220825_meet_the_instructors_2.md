## Drug Development Process, Preclinical, clinical, CMC. EU Regulatory Process. 
Presented by: Gautam Maitra, EPFL SV, Catalyze4Life.

## Overview of Preclinical Requirements - small Molecules and Biotech Products. 
Presented by: Hasnaà Haddouk, Head of Biological Sciences & Non Clinical Safety Immunology at Sobi - Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, Geneva, Switzerland.


### Sobi examples:
* Kineret (anakinra) is a recombinant protein drug approved for the treatment of patients with CAPS (cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome), RA (rheumatoid arthritis), FMF (familial Mediterranean fever), DIRA (deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) and Still's disease including systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) and adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD). Kineret blocks the biological activity of IL-1 by binding to the interleukin-1 type 1 receptor, expressed in a wide variety of tissues and organs. Anakinra differs from the sequence of Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist by one methionine amino acid added to its N-terminus; it also differs from the human protein in that it is not glycosylated, as it is manufactured in Escherichia coli.

* MEDI8897 (nirsevimab): Prefusion F-targeting Monoclonal Antibody for RSV infection. Sobi has the right to AstraZeneca's full share of US losses and profits for nirsevimab.

* loncastuximab tesirine: It is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized antibody targeting the protein CD19. It is stochastically conjugated via a valine-alanine cleavable, maleimide linker to a cytotoxic (anticancer) pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive, malignant, orphan disease in haematology with an incidence in Europe of approximately 4 cases per 100,000 adults per year. As many as 40 per cent of all patients with DLBCL will need at least a 2nd-line treatment as their disease is relapsing or refractory. For those patients, effective treatment options are limited, representing a critical unmet need. 

Q. When you are beginning a new project, are the circumstances unique each time, or do you have a prepared table of contents which you sequentially populate with completed regulatory steps?

Q. Do you have any particlar non-clinical safety steps that are most critical, or is it a complete gambit?

Q. In our course we have to absorb the mainstream regulatory standards quite fast. Are there any special regulations the apply to orphan drugs and rare disease where the number of cases is exteremly low and sometimes last resort. Keywords to search?

Q. part 1. Does the company actively push for open documentation - probably not since it's so much unneccessary work?
Q. part 2. Are there any examples of a product from SOBI that list or reference all of the fruitful steps that lead to market?

Q. SOBI is a good example of where drugs are used off-label. Could you say something about this; is there every any intention that a products' main application will be off-label?

## Clinical Trials in the EU and UK (post-Brexit).
Presented by: Anne Hamel, Senior Manager Regulatory Affairs at AC Immune SA.

Q. To navigate multiple regional regulations, do you tackle each region individually, in parallel or do you create some sort of master-document that you complete once and then adapt to each region?
