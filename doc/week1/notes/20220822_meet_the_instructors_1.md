Number one for CEO, must raise money. 

## Why many fail ? Case studies

Good funding, private and VC, etc.
Q. Prepare to fail.

Why is the majority of cash not on the front runner?
Q. However, investors always say - you have one product but what next? And pitches for single product, investors say no, I want share of whole company...

Case 2 is about BTN152 famous Ab trial.

Case 3 
convert from chemistry service to cancer Ab company, bought by bigger company. Ends up being a failure because no progress. The story was a sales pitch instead of eviednce-based.

Case 4
Phase III, very experienced colleagues (Biotech and CRO people).
But the trail is so big that the staff are not experienced in phase III.

## Typical startup pitch
PhD project was to make a start-up.

He didn't realise:
* The strategic founder brings:
* GLP tox can take 18-24 months
* Big invest for requirements
* Pleclinical and CMC to be IND ready
* Requires experience

### Interesting mentions
* Business agents club Basel. 
* Good, fast, or cheap, pick 2.
* Prioritise
* Righ to trial idea, risk, in US politics
* How to comunicate a product - founders, etc have no idea. 


## Other course notes from today

## Qs:
* The notes on moodle are excellent. You cite the index of a plan. I think you do not link the original on proposal to confirm, for the first hyperlinks, they link to old moodle forum posts, so they no longer work (for us). Do you have a link to the original?

* When you say that each individual will take at least 2 points, you mean for example:
	- ICH Guidelines - S2 Genotoxicity Studies
	- ICH Guidelines - S4 Toxicity Testing
Understand and summarise, list the requirements that we must comply.
* Translate the general terms to our specific product or keep the wording as found in the original guideline?

## Project proposals
*  Aaron Petruzzella (Drug) inhib of protease cathepsin s, and b. Ab delivery system for tissue specificty, invivo for the fist and want to do invivo for second. 
*  Alexandre Coudray (possibly Diagnostic) microfluidic drug screen devices using single cell in droplet with RNA express and ML to predict cell. 
*  Shiyu Cheng (Drug - Advanced Therapy) aftificial blood vessel.
*  Kunal Sharma (Medical Device - organ-on-a-chip) want to focus on regulatory, quite far already.

## Moodle notes

* knowing the  **t** arget, 
* identifying the  **m** olecule, 
*  **o** ptimizing the molecule, 
* doing the  **s** afety studies, 
* going into phase  **1, 2, 3**  and then 
* obtaining the  **r** egulatory approval, followed by 
* **m** arket launch after the reimbursement hurdle is managed. 

Entire process over 10 years in the majority of cases and cost over a billion CHF [Estimated Research and Development Investment Needed to Bring a New Medicine to Market, 2009-2018 - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32125404/)

A chain is only as strong as its weakest point. Work in tandem and work efficiently (from bench to bed). Deficiencies in any part of the value chain will be costly and time consuming. In the case of a single asset biotech, this can mean the demise of the company and the loss of shareholders investments.

Bringing drugs to the market entails ensuring quality, safety and efficacy of the product to the health authorities first before it goes to the consumer. The dossier going to the health authorities contains the "regulatory documents" which is rigorously reviewed by experts, the rest i.e., the raw data, the facility, the staff are regulated through inspections by the authorities before a complete approval.

This course entails three lines of work – quizzes, individual case study reports, and team presentation.

The case study and presentation are where you will be put on industry mode of work – managing the collective brain of a team, "unclear" instructions, deadlines, sifting through the information myriad, constantly changing priorities.

To give you some hints I am citing the index of the report template without the executive summary an advice to management:

[Part A. Preclinical Plan. 3](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=79557#_Toc20143650)

[Part B. Clinical Plan. 3](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=79557#_Toc20143651)

[Part C. Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls. 4](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=79557#_Toc20143652)

[Part D: Pre-IND Meeting / Scientific Advice. 5](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=79557#_Toc20143653)

[Part E: Inspection Readiness. 6](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=79557#_Toc20143654)

For Part A, each individual takes at least 2 points mainly from the ICH guidance: [M3\_R2\_ Step 4 June 11 2009 (ich.org)](https://database.ich.org/sites/default/files/M3_R2__Guideline.pdf). You may also choose from S guidance: [ICH Official web site : ICH](https://www.ich.org/page/safety-guidelines)

For Part B, each individual takes at least 2 points mainly from the ICH guidance: [ICH Official web site : ICH](https://www.ich.org/page/efficacy-guidelines)

For Part C, each individual takes at least 2 points mainly from the EUDRALEX Vol 10:[Requirements to the chemical and pharmaceutical quality documentation concerning investigational medicinal products in clinical trials - Rev. 2 (europa.eu)](https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-02/mp_eudralex_guideline-chemical_en_1.pdf)

For Part D, each individual takes at least 2 points mainly from the EMA guidance: [Scientific advice and protocol assistance | European Medicines Agency (europa.eu)](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/research-development/scientific-advice-protocol-assistance)

For Part E, each individual takes at least 2 points mainly from the EUDRALEX Vol 10: [ANNEX I - Investigator site (europa.eu)](https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2018-03/eudralex_vol10_chapter4_guidance-conduct_annex1_0.pdf)

Though we have mentioned the EU and ICH guidance as the main source, feel free to check the FDA website. We would like to compare and state the requirements from there if time allows. The content is not much different though the style is (review and communication). This is especially valid for inspections and Pre-IND meetings.

Moving to industry entails speaking the industry language and to be aware of their jargon.

Experience cannot be taught, but it can be shared. Case Studies come closest to experience and this is at the heart of your course.

Many dynamic companies, especially in the MedTech and biotech area have brought the regulatory profession to a C-level position. The first person the CEO talks to is the Chief Regulatory Officer, when it comes to whether the development work is regulatory-oriented and the prospective dossier will not be hit with a "refusal to file" notice.

Besides regular regulatory and compliance related activities, you may be confronted with unexpected situations. Here are some of the situations you might be called in to help –

A small company starts a clinical trial in Germany with an ambitious project with aggressive timelines and limited resources. After six months, the clinical trial contractor based in France goes bankrupt. How do you navigate the situation? What are the first three actions needed?

One of your patients on a clinical trial based from home, collapses at a dinner. How do you handle the situation?

At a party, the communication manager wraps the chocolate with a label stating that your clinical trial product saves patients. Where is the mistake? Why?

These are some of hundreds of incidents YOU will face.

Here is how you are expected to prioritize:

1.       Get to know the participants through Moodle to either be included in a team or lead a team after choosing your track – Drug or Device, then form teams.

2.       Include your photo into your profile if possible.

3.       Establish rapid communication pathway with your team.

4.       Respect the deadlines.

Teamwork is 50% of your time investment and will give you the opportunity to work across line functions, being objective, prioritizing, sifting through guidance to find the right answer, writing good documents and being culturally sensitive.

Lastly, when applying for a job after the course I would recommend stating that you have successfully completed a workshop on drug and device development where you dealt with business case studies driven by US FDA, EMA and ICH guidelines for regulatory submission, prepared for regulatory inspections and learnt the rigorous steps of preparing for Scientific advice /Pre-IND meetings. It may just work in your favour that you have bothered to obtain some education on the drug/device development process and get you an invitation to an interview.

There is some intensive reading at the outset but it can be managed with good planning.

You are advised to go through the following to get the bigger picture:

Thank you, and best wishes.
