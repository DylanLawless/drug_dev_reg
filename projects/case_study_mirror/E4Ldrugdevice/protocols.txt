# File formats and document sharing

We can change anything here.
To get moving here are some suggestions.

## Messaging 

* Slack - current choice.

## Document sharing

* Google drive - current choice.

* MS 365 Online - alternative
* Dropbox - alternative

Note:
* We will make this private to your email address of choice. Currently public.
* However, anything posted here should be considered public.

## File format

* MS word (docx) is the most universal file format.
* Google doc format - OK for rough work, but not good for adding citations, etc.

## Bibliography

* Add citation using reference manager, or simply add the hyperlink and Dylan will add citation later.
* Add the original document to the folder.
* .bib library file format - current choice.
* Reference managers can automatically convert to alternative formats if desired.
* Zotero app - I think the reference manager does not matter, but I use this here. 

## Division of work

1. For week 1 we will read the primary documents and populate the rough-work document.
2. Once we have an outline for what regulations are required for a complete drug development, we will then 
	- identify which are most importance to focus on or relevant to our case,
	- lastly we will pick ~2 each as advised and complete our individual assignments.
3. We will complete our work in the shared folders and review together to keep on track.
4. We will then merge the complete document and build the presentation.
5. We will decide on the presentation method later.
