	abstract = {Following Milstein's discovery, the monoclonal antibodies ({mAbs}) became a basic tool for biomedical science. In cancer field, since the first {mAb} was approved by the {FDA} a great improvement took place making of them a therapeutic option for many cancer types in the current clinical practice. Today, {mAbs} are being developed to target different molecules with different mechanisms of action and its target potential is unlimited. However, this huge and fast growing new field needs to be organized to better understand the treatment options we have to confront different cancer diseases. Current cancer targeted immunotherapies aim to achieve different goals like the regulation of osteoclast function, the delivery of cytotoxic drugs into tumor cells and the blockade of oncogenic pathways, neo-angiogenesis and immune checkpoints. Here, we reviewed the most relevant therapeutic {mAbs} for solid tumors available in current clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Six healthy young male volunteers at a contract research organization were enrolled in the first phase 1 clinical trial of {TGN}1412, a novel superagonist  anti-{CD}28 monoclonal antibody that directly stimulates T cells. Within 90 minutes  after receiving a single intravenous dose of the drug, all six volunteers had a  systemic inflammatory response characterized by a rapid induction of  proinflammatory cytokines and accompanied by headache, myalgias, nausea,  diarrhea, erythema, vasodilatation, and hypotension. Within 12 to 16 hours after  infusion, they became critically ill, with pulmonary infiltrates and lung injury,  renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Severe and unexpected  depletion of lymphocytes and monocytes occurred within 24 hours after infusion.  All six patients were transferred to the care of the authors at an intensive care  unit at a public hospital, where they received intensive cardiopulmonary support  (including dialysis), high-dose methylprednisolone, and an anti-interleukin-2  receptor antagonist antibody. Prolonged cardiovascular shock and acute  respiratory distress syndrome developed in two patients, who required intensive  organ support for 8 and 16 days. Despite evidence of the multiple  cytokine-release syndrome, all six patients survived. Documentation of the  clinical course occurring over the 30 days after infusion offers insight into the  systemic inflammatory response syndrome in the absence of contaminating  pathogens, endotoxin, or underlying disease.},
