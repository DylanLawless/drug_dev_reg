	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The mean cost of developing a new drug has been the subject of debate, with recent estimates ranging from \$314 million to \$2.8 billion.  OBJECTIVE: To estimate the research and development investment required to bring  a new therapeutic agent to market, using publicly available data. DESIGN AND  SETTING: Data were analyzed on new therapeutic agents approved by the US Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) between 2009 and 2018 to estimate the research and  development expenditure required to bring a new medicine to market. Data were  accessed from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Drugs@FDA database, and  ClinicalTrials.gov, alongside published data on clinical trial success rates.  EXPOSURES: Conduct of preclinical and clinical studies of new therapeutic agents.  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Median and mean research and development spending on  new therapeutic agents approved by the FDA, capitalized at a real cost of capital  rate (the required rate of return for an investor) of 10.5\% per year, with  bootstrapped CIs. All amounts were reported in 2018 US dollars. RESULTS: The FDA  approved 355 new drugs and biologics over the study period. Research and  development expenditures were available for 63 (18\%) products, developed by 47  different companies. After accounting for the costs of failed trials, the median  capitalized research and development investment to bring a new drug to market was  estimated at \$985.3 million (95\% CI, \$683.6 million-\$1228.9 million), and the  mean investment was estimated at \$1335.9 million (95\% CI, \$1042.5 million-\$1637.5  million) in the base case analysis. Median estimates by therapeutic area (for  areas with ≥5 drugs) ranged from \$765.9 million (95\% CI, \$323.0 million-\$1473.5  million) for nervous system agents to \$2771.6 million (95\% CI, \$2051.8  million-\$5366.2 million) for antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents. Data  were mainly accessible for smaller firms, orphan drugs, products in certain  therapeutic areas, first-in-class drugs, therapeutic agents that received  accelerated approval, and products approved between 2014 and 2018. Results varied  in sensitivity analyses using different estimates of clinical trial success  rates, preclinical expenditures, and cost of capital. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:  This study provides an estimate of research and development costs for new  therapeutic agents based on publicly available data. Differences from previous  studies may reflect the spectrum of products analyzed, the restricted  availability of data in the public domain, and differences in underlying  assumptions in the cost calculations.},

	abstract = {Six healthy young male volunteers at a contract research organization were enrolled in the first phase 1 clinical trial of TGN1412, a novel superagonist  anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody that directly stimulates T cells. Within 90 minutes  after receiving a single intravenous dose of the drug, all six volunteers had a  systemic inflammatory response characterized by a rapid induction of  proinflammatory cytokines and accompanied by headache, myalgias, nausea,  diarrhea, erythema, vasodilatation, and hypotension. Within 12 to 16 hours after  infusion, they became critically ill, with pulmonary infiltrates and lung injury,  renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Severe and unexpected  depletion of lymphocytes and monocytes occurred within 24 hours after infusion.  All six patients were transferred to the care of the authors at an intensive care  unit at a public hospital, where they received intensive cardiopulmonary support  (including dialysis), high-dose methylprednisolone, and an anti-interleukin-2  receptor antagonist antibody. Prolonged cardiovascular shock and acute  respiratory distress syndrome developed in two patients, who required intensive  organ support for 8 and 16 days. Despite evidence of the multiple  cytokine-release syndrome, all six patients survived. Documentation of the  clinical course occurring over the 30 days after infusion offers insight into the  systemic inflammatory response syndrome in the absence of contaminating  pathogens, endotoxin, or underlying disease.},

In cancer field, since the first mAb was approved by the FDA a great improvement took place making of them a therapeutic option for many cancer types in the current clinical practice. Today, mAbs are being developed to target different molecules with different mechanisms of action and its target potential is unlimited. However, this huge and fast growing new field needs to be organized to better understand the treatment options we have to confront different cancer diseases. Current cancer targeted immunotherapies aim to achieve different goals like the regulation of osteoclast function, the delivery of cytotoxic drugs into tumor cells and the blockade of oncogenic pathways, neo-angiogenesis and immune checkpoints. Here, we reviewed the most relevant therapeutic mAbs for solid tumors available in current clinical practice.},
