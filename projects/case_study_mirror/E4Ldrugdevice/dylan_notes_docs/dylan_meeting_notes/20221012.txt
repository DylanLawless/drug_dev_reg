* Present: 
- Dylan
- Mouna

The following notes were written after, but basically summarise what we discussed. I've posted this message on slack for the others. 

The report is a drug development plan. We say things like "we will do study X with X participants to determine X". Preclinical and clinical will be very similar but from animals to humans. The same for CMC, etc.

The most efficient way is to:
1. Find completed summaries of work that at were done for Trastuzumab (Herceptin).
2. Duplicate your section of interest.
3. They may have done many preclinical, clinical trials. You probably only need to copy one trial plan for each section. (Copy the plan, ignore their final result).
4. Cite the relevant regulatory document which mention that topic (e.g. "In accordance with regulation X will perform study Y by doing Z").

Some useful docs to find those examples are in:
E4Ldrugdevice > dylan_notes_docs > dylan_literature
* reg_literature
* mab_cmc

These 3 are useful:
* EMA_herceptin-epar-scientific-discussion_en.pdf
* Herceptin_PM_E_PRODUCT MONOGRAPH.pdf
* FDA-Briefing-Information-for-the-July-13--2017-Meeting-of-the-Oncologic-Drugs-Advisory-Committee-(PM-Session).pdf

Each of you found and shared these examples, so I am just duplicating. If you do new sections for parts C-E which were not discussed yet, it may be useful to note it in regulation_table.csv to prevent people duplicating work (but not majorly important).
If you upload on google drive, we might be able to compare. I won't be free for any further calls. Next week we will make a plan for the final group presentation.
