## EU regulation

* Guidance - MDCG endorsed documents and other guidance
<https://health.ec.europa.eu/medical-devices-sector/new-regulations/guidance-mdcg-endorsed-documents-and-other-guidance_en>
* This page provides a range of documents to assist stakeholders in applying 
	- [Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR): CELEX:02017R0746-20170505](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02017R0746-20170505) and

## Choosing a legal structure in Switzerland
* SME portal <https://www.kmu.admin.ch/kmu/en/home/concrete-know-how/setting-up-sme/starting-business/choosing-legal-structure.html>

* The administration structure comes from:
```
├── The Federal Council
│   ├── EAER: Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Researc
│   │   ├── SECO: State Secretariat for Economic Affairs
│   │   │   ├── SME Portal small and medium-sized enterprises
```

The SME provides <https://www.easygov.swiss/easygov/#/en> and includes:

* Entry in the Commercial Register
* Corporate taxes
* Social security/insurances
* VAT
* Insurance
* Debt enforcement proceedings
* Suva salary declaration
* Support with financing (Confederation supported bank loans)
* Protection rights (IIP)
* SOGC publications (e.g. shareholder's meeting invitations, notifications for annual financial statements and dividend payments, etc.)
* Working conditions
* Reports and permits under the law on foreign nationals
* Federal Supervisory Board for Foundations

## Checklist: Forming a company
[Source admin.ch](https://www.kmu.admin.ch/kmu/en/home/concrete-know-how/setting-up-sme/starting-business/choosing-legal-structure/checklist-forming-a-company.html). The main points to be respected are outlined below:

### All legal forms
* Budget for start-up costs
* Arrange a tax consultation and calculation in relation to the formation
* Determine a business name (to be clarified with the cantonal commercial registry office)
* Register for the Old-Age and Survivor Insurance (OSI) pension fund
* Determine VAT status. If VAT must be paid, register with the Federal Tax Administration.

### With employees
* Register employees for the Old-Age and Survivor Insurance pension fund and take out the mandatory insurance for the Occupational Pension Plan (OPP) and Professional Accident Insurance (PAI) (note: owners of companies with share capital [corps. and LLCs] are subject to the same social insurance obligations as employees)

### All legal forms, excluding sole proprietorships
* Prepare a business contract and articles of association
* Register with the commercial register
* Determine the necessary bodies: board of directors/partners, management, administration or committee; auditor
* Send formation instruments to a notary for review and to the commercial register; adapt if necessary
* Request a declaration of acceptance from the auditor
* Organize a general meeting

### LLC and Corp.
* Determine the corporate capital, in particular the share capital, distribution and settlement (payment of dividends)
* Choose a bank for the corporate shares and open an account
* Pay the amount to the bank for paid-in corporate shares and member's shares (present a copy of the registration with the commercial register)
* Issue a certificate of corporate shares and units, begin keeping accounting records for the shares and the company

## External learning (ext_)
I am adding my external learning/courses here for now. I may move them to a separate repo in the future since they are diverse; micro/macro econ, philosophy econ, history, and math/stats.
All external learning will be arranged in directories named as "ext_". For example "ext_finance".

### Mathematics with app in finance

I am watching these lectures but not explicitly making documentation for it.
* [MIT 18.S096 Topics in Mathematics with Applications in Finance](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-s096-topics-in-mathematics-with-applications-in-finance-fall-2013/)
* Video link: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXDB9dMdEo&list=PLaLOVNqqD-2G5SSErHfvGqs7ev7kE8_fj&index=1&t=161s>

### History of economic thought

I am keeping my notes on macroeconomics here for now. While not directly relevant, I want this notes available for perspective.

## Cloning and keys
Since I work with others and use different accounts, machines, emails, here are some notes in case you or I need them.

To push to multiple github accounts with different keys,
and different machines, these settings can be used.
Instead of a global git config, local configs are used for each repo.
Here is the example with two of my repos.
The custom usernames for the local repo is shown (but custom email is removed to prevent spam).
[Create your ssh keys as per github recommendation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent). 
In the .ssh directory, the config file will assign the key to each git repository that you clone based on the Host that you use. i.e. custom instead of the default:

* git clone git@custom.github.com:accout/repo.git
* git clone git@github.com:accout/repo.git

``` bash 
## Set up the ssh config file
cd ~/.ssh/config

## set such that Host and User are custom
# lawlessgenomics repo
Host dylanlawless.github.com
  HostName github.com
  User DylanLawless
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key1_rsa
  IdentitiesOnly yes

# sarscov2 repo
Host sarscov2voc.github.com
  HostName github.com
  User sars-cov-2-voc
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key2_rsa
  IdentitiesOnly yes

```

Then clone your repo using the custom Host instead of the default provided by github when you use button "clone/ssh/copy".

``` bash
# Clone using the correct Host as per config.
# As shown at the end of this page, you may need to clone with submodules.
# You can do by add the "--recursive" flag. 
git clone --recursive git@dylanlawless.github.com:DylanLawless/drug_dev_reg

# Set the local user here (instead of global, i.e. /Users/user/.gitconfig)
cd "the clone repo dir"
git config user.email personemail@addess.com
git config user.name DylanLawless
```

You should now be able to pull and push from that repo without the ["incorrect user" problems](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4665337/git-pushing-to-remote-github-repository-as-wrong-user).
